<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ummer comes late along the Cape Breton
shore; and even while it stays there is something
a little diffident and ticklish about it,
as if each clear warm day might perhaps be
the last. Though by early June the fields are in their
first emerald, there are no flowers yet. The little convent
girls who carry the banners at the head of the
Corpus Christi procession at Arichat wear wreaths of
artificial lilies of the valley and marguerites over their
white veils, and often enough their teeth chatter with
cold before the completion of the long march&mdash;out
from the church portals westward by the populous
street, then up through the steep open fields to the old
Calvary on top of the hill, then back to the church along
the grass-grown upper road, far above the roofs, in
full view of the wide bay.</p>

<p>Despite some discomforts, the procession is a very
great event; every house along the route is decked out
with bunting or flags or a bright home-made carpet,
hung from a window. Pots of tall geraniums in scarlet
bloom have been set out on the steps; and numbers
of little evergreen trees, or birches newly in leaf, have
been brought in from the country and bound to the
fences. Along the roadside are gathered all the Acadians
from the neighboring parishes, devoutly gay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
enchanted with the pious spectacle. The choir, following
after the richly canopied Sacrament and swinging
censers, are chanting psalms of benediction and thanksgiving;
banners and flags and veils flutter in the wind;
the harbor, ice-bound so many months, is flecked with
dancing white-caps and purple shadows: surely summer
cannot be far off.</p>

<p>"When once the ice has done passing <i>down there</i>,"
they say&mdash;"which may happen any time now&mdash;you
will see! Perhaps all in a day the change will come.
The fog that creeps in so cold at night&mdash;it will all be
sucked up; the sky will be clear as glass down to the
very edge of the water. Ah, the fine season it will
be!"</p>

<p>That is the way summer arrives on the Acadian
shore: everything bursting pell-mell into bloom; daisies
and buttercups and August flowers rioting in the
fields, lilacs and roses shedding their fragrance in sheltered
gardens; and over all the world a drench of
unspeakable sunlight.</p>

<p>You could never forget your first sight of Arichat if
you entered its narrow harbor at this divine moment.
Steep, low hills, destitute of trees, set a singularly definite
sky-line just behind; and the town runs&mdash;dawdles,
rather&mdash;in a thin, wavering band for some miles sheer
on the edge of the water. Eight or ten wharves, some
of them fallen into dilapidation, jut out at intervals
from clumps of weatherbeaten storehouses; and a few
small vessels, it may be, are lying up alongside or
anchored idly off shore. Only the occasional sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a creaking block or of a wagon rattling by on the hard
roadway breaks the silence.</p>

<p>Along the street the houses elbow one another in
neighborly groups, or straggle out in single file, separated
by bits of declivitous white-fenced yard; and to
the westward, a little distance up the hill, sits the
square church, far outvying every other edifice in size
and dignity, glistening white, with a tall bronze Virgin
on the peak of the roof&mdash;Our Lady of the Assumption,
the special patron of the Acadians.</p>

<p>But what impresses you above all is the incredible
vividness of color in this landscape: the dazzling gold-green
of the fields, heightened here and there by luminous
patches of foam-white where the daisies are in
full carnival, or subdued to duller tones where, on uncultivated
ground, moss-hummocks and patches of rock
break through the investiture of grass. The sky has
so much room here too: the whole world seems to be
adrift in azure; the thin strip of land hangs poised
between, claimed equally by firmament and the waters
under it.</p>

<p>In the old days, they tell us, Arichat was a very different
place from now. Famous among the seaports
of the Dominion, it saw a continual coming and going
of brigs and ships and barquentines in the South American
fish trade.</p>

<p>"But if you had known it then!" they say. "The
wharves were as thick all the length of the harbor as
the teeth of a comb; and in winter, when the vessels
were laid up&mdash;eh, mon Dieu! you would have called it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a forest, for all the masts and spars you saw there.
No indeed, it was not dreamed of in those days that
Arichat would ever come to this!"</p>

<p>So passes the world's glory! An air of tender,
almost jealous reminiscence hangs about the town; and
in its gentle decline into obscurity it has kept a sort of
dignity, a self-possession, a certain look of wisdom and
experience, which in a sense make it proof against all
arrows of outrageous Fortune.</p>

<p>Back from the other shore of the harbor, jutting out
for some miles into Chedabucto Bay, lies the Cape.
You get a view of it if you climb to the crest of the
hill&mdash;a broad reach of barrens, fretted all day by the
sea. Out there it is what the Acadians call a bad
country. About the sluice-like coves that have been
eaten into its rocky shore are scrambling groups of
fishermen's houses; but aside from these and the lighthouse
on the spit of rocks to southward, the region is
uninhabited&mdash;a waste of rock and swamp-alder and
scrub-balsam, across which a single thread of a road
takes its circuitous way, dipping over steep low hills,
turning out for gnarls of rock and patches of gleaming
marsh, losing itself amid dense thickets of alder, then
emerging upon some bare hilltop, where the whole
measureless sweep of sea and sky fills the vision.</p>

<p>When the dusk begins to fall of an autumn afternoon&mdash;between
dog and wolf, as the saying goes&mdash;you
could almost believe in the strange noises&mdash;the
rumblings, clankings, shrill voices&mdash;that are to be
heard above the dull roar of the sea by belated passers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
on the barrens. Some people have seen death-fires
too, and a headless creature, much like a horse, galloping
through the darkness; and over there at Fougère's
Cove, the most remote settlement of the Cape, there
were knockings at doors through all one winter from
hands not human. The Fougères&mdash;they were mostly
of one tribe there&mdash;were driven to desperation; they
consulted a priest; they protected themselves with
blessed images, with prayers and holy water; and no
harm came to them, though poor Marcelle, who was a
<i>jeune fille</i> of marriageable age, was prostrated for a
year with the fright of it.</p>

<p>This barren territory, where nothing grows above
the height of a man's shoulder, still goes by the name
of "the woods"&mdash;<i>les bois</i>&mdash;among the Acadians.
"Once the forest was magnificent here," they tell you&mdash;"trees
as tall as the church tower; but the great fire
swept it all away; and never has there been a good
growth since. For one thing, you see, we must get our
firewood from it somehow."</p>

<p>This fact accounts for a curious look in the ubiquitous
stubby evergreens: their lower branches spread
flat and wide close on the ground,&mdash;that is where the
snow in winter protects them,&mdash;and above reaches a
thin, spire-like stem, trimmed close, except for new
growth at the top, of all its branches. It gives suggestion
of a harsh, misshapen, all but defeated existence;
the adverse forces are so tyrannical out here on
the Cape, the material of life so sparse.</p>

<p>I remember once meeting a little funeral train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
crossing the barrens. They were bearing the body of
a young girl, Anna Béjean, to its last rest, five miles
away by the road, in the yard of the parish church
amongst the wooden crosses. The long box of pine
lay on the bottom of a country wagon, and a wreath
of artificial flowers and another of home-dyed immortelles
were fastened to the cover. A young fisherman,
sunburned and muscular, was leading the horse along
the rough road, and behind followed three or four
carts, carrying persons in black, all of middle age or
beyond, and silent.</p>

<p>Yet in the full tide of summer the barrens have a
beauty in which this characteristic melancholy is only
a persistent undertone. Then the marshes flush rose-pink
with lovely multitudes of calopogons that cluster
like poising butterflies amongst the dark grasses; here
too the canary-yellow bladderwort flecks the black
pools, and the red, leathery pitcher-plant springs in
sturdy clumps from the moss-hummocks. And the
wealth of color over all the country!&mdash;gray rock
touched into life with sky-reflections; rusty green of
alder thickets, glistening silver-green of balsam and
juniper; and to the sky-line, wherever it can keep its
hold, the thin, variegated carpet of close-cropped
grass, where creeping berries of many kinds grow in
profusion. Flocks of sheep scamper untended over the
barrens all day, and groups of horses, turned out to
shift for themselves while the fishing season keeps their
owners occupied, look for a moment, nose in the air,
at the passer, kick up their heels, and race off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>As you turn back again toward Arichat you catch a
glimpse of its glistening white church, miles distant in
reality, but looking curiously near, across a landscape
where none of the familiar standards of measure
exist. You lose it on the next decline; then it flashes
in sight again, and the blue, sun-burnished expanse of
water between. It occurs to you that the whole life of
of the country finds its focus there: christenings and
first communions, marriages and burials&mdash;how wonderfully
the church holds them all in her keeping; how
she sends out her comfort and her exhortation, her
reproach and her eternal hope across even this bad
country, where the circumstances of human life are so
ungracious.</p>

<p>But it is on a Sunday morning, when, in response to
the quavering summons of the chapel bell, the whole
countryside gives up its population, that you get the
clearest notion of what religion means in the life of
the Acadians. From the doorway of our house, which
was close to the road at the upper end of the harbor,
we could see the whole church-going procession from
the outlying districts. The passing would be almost
unbroken from eight o'clock on for more than an hour
and a half: a varied, vivacious, friendly human stream.
They came in hundreds from the scattered villages and
hamlets of the parish&mdash;from Petit de Grat and Little
Anse and Pig Cove and Gros Nez and Point Rouge
and Cap au Guet, eight or nine miles often enough.</p>

<p>First, those who went afoot and must allow plenty
of time on account of age: bent old fishermen, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
yellowed and shiny coats had been made for more
robust shoulders; old women, invariably in short black
capes, and black bonnets tied tight under the chin, and
in their hands a rosary and perhaps a thumb-worn missal.
Then troops of children, much <i>endimanché</i>,&mdash;one
would like to say "Sundayfied,"&mdash;trotting along
noisily, stopping to examine every object of interest by
the way, extracting all the excitement possible out of
the weekly pilgrimage.</p>

<p>A little later the procession became more general:
young and old and middle-aged together. In Sunday
boots that creaked loudly passed numbers of men and
boys, sometimes five or six abreast, reaching from side
to side of the street, sometimes singly attendant upon
a conscious young person of the other sex. The wagons
are beginning to appear now, scattering the pedestrians
right and left as they rattle by, bearing whole
families packed in little space; and away across the
harbor, you see a small fleet of brown sails putting off
from the Cape for the nearer shore.</p>

<p>Outside the church, in the open space before the
steps, is gathered a constantly growing multitude, a
dense, restless swarm of humanity, full of gossip and
prognostic, until suddenly the bell stops its clangor
overhead; then there is a surging up the steps and
through the wide doors of the sanctuary; and outside
all is quiet once more.</p>

<p>The Acadians do not appear greatly to relish the
more solemn things of religion. They like better a
religion demurely gay, pervaded by light and color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Elle est très chic, notre petite église, n'est-ce pas?"
was a comment made by a pious soul of my acquaintance,
eager to uphold the honor of her parish.</p>

<p>Proper, mild-featured saints and smiling Virgins in
painted robes and gilt haloes abound in the Acadian
churches; on the altars are lavish decorations of artificial
flowers&mdash;silver lilies, paper roses, red and purple
immortelles; and the ceilings and pillars and wall-spaces
are often done in blue and pink, with gold stars;
such a style, one imagines, as might appeal to our modern
St. Valentine. The piety that expresses itself in
this inoffensive gayety of embellishment is more akin
to that which moves universal humanity to don its
finery o' Sundays,&mdash;to the greater glory of God,&mdash;than
to the sombre, death-remembering zeal of some
other communities. A kind religion this, one not without
its coquetries, gracious, tactful, irresistible, interweaving
itself throughout the very texture of the common
life.</p>

<p>Last summer, out at Petit de Grat, three miles from
Arichat, where the people have just built a little church
of their own, they held a "Grand Picnic and Ball" for
the raising of funds with which to erect a glebe house.
The priest authorized the affair, but stipulated that
sunset should end each day's festivities, so that all
decencies might be respected. This parish picnic started
on a Monday and continued daily for the rest of the
week&mdash;that is to say, until all that there was to sell
was sold, and until all the youth of the vicinity had
danced their legs to exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>An unoccupied shop was given over to the sale of
cakes, tartines, doughnuts, imported fruits, syrup
drinks (unauthorized beverages being obtainable elsewhere),
to the vending of chances on wheels of fortune,
target-shooting, dice-throwing, hooked rugs,
shawls, couvertures, knitted hoods, and the like; and
above all the hubbub and excitement twanged the ceaseless,
inevitable voice of a graphophone, reviving long-forgotten
rag-time.</p>

<p>Outside, most conspicuous on the treeless slope of
hill, was a "pavilion" of boards, bunting-decked, on
which, from morn till eve, rained the incessant clump-clump
of happy feet. For music there was a succession
of performers and of instruments: a mouth-organ,
a fiddle, a concertina, each lending its particular quality
of gayety to the dance; the mouth-organ, shrill,
extravagant, whimsical, failing in richness; the concertina,
rich, noisy, impetuous, failing in fine shades; the
fiddle, wheedling, provocative, but a little thin. And
besides&mdash;the fiddle is not what it used to be in the
hands of old Fortune.</p>

<p>Fortune died a year ago, and he was never appreciated
till death snatched him from us: the skinniest,
most ramshackle of mankind, tall, loose-jointed, shuffling
in gait; at all other times than those that called
his art into play, a shiftless, hang-dog sort of personage,
who would always be begging a coat of you, or
asking the gift of ten cents to buy him some tobacco.
But at a dance he was a despot unchallenged. Only to
hear him jig off the Irish Washerwoman was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
acknowledge his preëminence. His bleary eyes and
tobacco-stained lips took on a radiance, his body rocked
to and fro, vibrated to the devil-may-care rhythm of
the thing, while his left foot emphatically rapped out
the measure.</p>

<p>Until another genius shall be raised up amongst us,
Fortune's name will be held in cherished memory. For
that matter, it is not likely to die out, since, on the day
of his death, the old reprobate was married to the
mother of his seven children&mdash;baptized, married,
administered, and shuffled off in a day.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to any of us, somehow, that
Fortune might be as transitory and impermanent as
his patron goddess herself. We had always accepted
him as a sort of ageless thing, a living symbol, a peripatetic
mortal, coming out of Petit de Grat, and going
about, tobacco in cheek, fiddle under arm, as irresponsible
as mirth itself among the sons of men. God rest
him! Another landmark gone.</p>

<p>And old Maximen Forêt, too, from whom one used
to take weather-wisdom every day&mdash;his bench out
there in the sun is empty. Maximen's shop was just
across the street from our house&mdash;a long, darkish,
tunnel-like place under a steep roof. Tinware of all
descriptions hung in dully shining array from the ceiling;
barrels and a rusty stove and two broad low
counters occupied most of the floor space, and the
atmosphere was charged with a curious sharp odor in
which you could distinguish oil and tobacco and
molasses. The floor was all dented full of little holes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
like a honeycomb, where Maximen had walked over it
with his iron-pointed crutch; for he was something of
a cripple. But you rarely had any occasion to enter
the smelly little shop, for no one ever bought much of
anything there nowadays.</p>

<p>Instead, you sat down on the sunny bench beside the
old man&mdash;Acadian of the Acadians&mdash;and listened to
his tireless, genial babble&mdash;now French, now English,
as the humor struck him.</p>

<p>"It go mak' a leetle weat'er, m'sieu," he would
say. "I t'ink you better not go fur in the p'tit caneau
t'is day. Dere is squall&mdash;là-bas&mdash;see, dark&mdash;may
be t'unner. Dat is not so unlike, dis mont'. Oh, w'at
a hell time for de hays!"</p>

<p>For everybody who passed he had a greeting, even
for those who had hastened his business troubles
through never paying their accounts. To the last he
never lost his faith in their good intentions.</p>

<p>"Dose poor devil fishermen," he would say, "however
dey mak' leeve, God know. You t'ink I mak'
'em go wid notting? It ain't lak dat wit' me here yet,
m'sieu. Dey pay some day, when le bon Dieu, he
send dem some feesh; dat's sure sure."</p>

<p>If it happened that anybody stopped on business, old
Maximen would hobble to the door and tug violently
at a bell-rope.</p>

<p>"Cr-r-r-line! Cr-r-r-line!" he would call.</p>

<p>"Tout d' suite!" answered a shrill voice from some
remoter portion of the edifice; and a moment later an
old woman with straggling white hair, toothless gums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and penetrating, humorous eyes, deepset under a forehead
of infinite wrinkles, would come shuffling up the
pebble walk from the basement.</p>

<p>"Me voila!" she would ejaculate, panting. "Me
ol' man, he always know how to git me in a leetle minute,
hé?"</p>

<p>On Sundays Caroline and Maximen would drive to
chapel in a queer, heavy, antiquated road-cart that had
been built especially for his use, hung almost as low
between the axles as a chariot.</p>

<p>"We go mak' our respec' to the bon Dieu," he
would laugh, as he took the reins in hand and waited
for Célestine, the chunky little mare, to start&mdash;which
she did when the mood took her.</p>

<p>The small shop is closed and beginning to fall to
pieces. Maximen has been making his respects amid
other surroundings for some four or five years, and
Caroline, at the end of a twelvemonth of lonely waiting,
followed after.</p>

<p>"It seem lak I need t'e ol' man to look out for," she
used to say. "All t'e day I listen to hear t'at bell
again. 'Tout d' suite! I used to call, no matter what
I do&mdash;maybe over the stove or pounding my bread;
and den, 'Me voila, mon homme!' I would be at t'e
shop, ready to help."</p>

<p>I suppose that wherever a man looks in the world,
if he but have the eyes to see, he finds as much of gayety
and pathos, of failure and courage, as in any particular
section of it; yet so much at least is true: that
in a little community like this, so removed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
larger, more spectacular conflicts of life, so face to
face, all the year, with the inveterate and domineering
forces of nature, one seems to discover a more poignant
relief in all the homely, familiar, universal episodes
of the human comedy.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t was a boy of ten who listened to La Rose,
and while he listened, the sun stood still in
the sky, there was an enchantment on all
the world. Whatever La Rose said you had
to believe, somehow. Oh, I assure you, no one could
be more exacting than she in the matter of proofs.
For persons who would give an ear to any absurd story
tattled abroad she had nothing but contempt.</p>

<p>"Before you believe a thing," said La Rose, sagely,
"you must know whether it is true or not. That is
the most important part of a story."</p>

<p>She would give a decisive nod to her small head and
shut her lips together almost defiantly. Yet always,
somewhere in the corner of her alert gray eye, there
seemed to be lurking the ghost of a twinkle. La Rose
had no age. She was both very young and very old.
For all she had never traveled more than ten miles
from the little Cape Breton town of Port l'Évêque,
you had the feeling that she had seen a good deal of
the world, and it is certain that her life had not been
easy; yet she would laugh as quickly and abundantly
as a young girl just home from the convent.</p>

<p>These two were the best of comrades. La Rose had
been the boy's nurse when he was little, and as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
no mother she had kept a feeling of special affection
and responsibility for him. Thus it happened that
whenever she was making some little expedition out
across the harbor&mdash;say for blueberries on the barrens,
or white moorberries, or ginseng&mdash;she would get permission
from the captain for Michel to go with her;
and this was the happiest privilege in the boy's life.
Most of all because of the stories La Rose would tell
him.</p>

<p>La Rose had a story to tell about every spot they visited,
about every person they passed. She had been
brought up, herself, out here on the Cape; and not an
inch of its territory but was familiar to her.</p>

<p>"Now that is where those Bucherons lived," she observed
one day, as they were walking homeward from
Pig Cove by the Calvaire road. "They are all gone
now, and the house is almost fallen to pieces; but once
things were lively enough there&mdash;mon Dieu, oui!&mdash;quite
lively enough for comfort."</p>

<p>She gave a sagacious nod to her head, with the look
of one who could say more, and would, if you urged
her a little.</p>

<p>"Was it at the Bucherons' that all the chairs stood
on one leg?" asked Michel, thrilling mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Oui, c'est ça," answered La Rose, in a voice of the
most sepulchral, "right there in that house, the chairs
stood on one leg and went rap&mdash;rap&mdash;against the
floor. And more than once a table with dishes and
other things on it fell over, and there were strange
sounds in the cupboard. Oh, it is certain those Bucherons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
were tormented; but for that matter they had
brought it on themselves because of their greediness
and their hard hearts. It came for a punishment; and
when they repented themselves, it went away."</p>

<p>"I haven't ever heard all the story about the Bucherons,"
said Michel&mdash;"or at least, not since I was
big. I am almost sure I would like it."</p>

<p>"Well, I daresay," agreed La Rose. "It is an interesting
story in some ways; and the best of it is, it is not
one of those stories that are only to make you laugh,
and then you go right away and forget them. And
another thing: this story about the Bucherons really
happened. It was when my poor stepmother was a girl.
She lived at Pig Cove then, and that is only two miles
from Gros Nez. And one of those Bucherons was
once wanting to marry her; but do you think she would
have anything to do with a man like that?</p>

<p>"'No,' she said. 'I will have nothing to do with
you. I would sooner not ever be married, me, than to
have you for my man.'</p>

<p>"And the reason she spoke that way was because of
the cruelty they had shown toward that poor widow of
a Noémi, which everybody on the Cape knew about,
and it was a great scandal. And if you want me to tell
you about it, that is what I am going to do now."</p>

<p>La Rose seated herself on a flat rock by the road,
and Michel found another for himself close by. Below
them lay a deep rocky cove, with shores as steep
as a sluice, and close above its inner margin stood the
shell of a small house. The chimney had fallen in, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
windows were all gone&mdash;only vacant holes now,
through which you saw the daylight from the other
side, and the roof had begun to sag.</p>

<p>"Yes," said La Rose, "it will soon be gone to pieces
entirely, and then there will be nothing to remind anyone
of those Bucherons and what torments they had.
You see there were four of them, an old woman and
two sons, and one of the sons was married, but there
were not any children; and all those four must have
had stones instead of hearts. They were only thinking
how they could get the better of other people, and so
become rich.</p>

<p>"And before that there had been three sons at home;
but one of them&mdash;Benoît his name was&mdash;had married
a certain Noémi Boudrot; and she was as sweet and
beautiful as a lily, and he too was different from the
others; and so they had not lived here, but had got a
little house at Pig Cove, where they were very happy;
and the good God sent them two children, of a beauty
and gentleness indescribable; and they called them
Évangéline and little Benoît, but you do not need to
remember that, because it is not a part of the story.</p>

<p>"So things went on that way for quite a while; and
all the time those four Bucherons were growing more
and more hard-hearted, like four serpents in a pile
together.</p>

<p>"Well, one day in October that Benoît Bucheron
who lived in Pig Cove was going alone in a small cart
to Port l'Évêque to buy some provisions for winter&mdash;flour,
I suppose, and meal, and perhaps some clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and some tobacco; and instead of going direct by the
Gros Nez road, he came around this way by the Calvaire
so as to stop in and speak to his relatives; and to
see them welcoming him, you would never have suspected
their stone hearts. But Benoît was solemn for
all that, as if troubled by some idea. Then that sly
old mother, she said:</p>

<p>"'Dear Benoît,' she said, 'what troubles you? Can
you not put trust in your own mother, who loves you
better than her eyes and nose?'&mdash;and she smiled at
him just like a fat wicked old spider that is waiting for
a fly to come and get tangled up in her net.</p>

<p>"But Benoît only remembered then that she was his
mother; so he said:</p>

<p>"'I have a fear, me, that I shall not be long for this
world, my mother. Last week I saw a little blue fire
on the barrens one night, and again one night I heard
hoofs going <i>claquin-claquant</i> down there on the beach,
much like the horse without head. And that is why I
am getting my provisions so early, and making everything
ready for the winter. See,' he said, 'here is the
thirteen dollars I have saved this year. I am going to
buy things with it in Port l'Évêque.'</p>

<p>"Now you may depend that when he showed them
all that money, their eyes stuck out like the eyes of
crabs; but of course they did not say anything only
some words of the most comforting. And finally he
said, getting ready to go:</p>

<p>"'If anything should happen,' he said, 'will you
promise me to be good to that poor Noémi and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
two poor little innocent lambs?'&mdash;and those serpents
said, certainly, they would do all that was possible;
and with that Benoît gets into his cart, and starts down
the hill; and suddenly the horse takes a fright of something
and runs away, and the cart tips over, and Benoît
is thrown out; and when his brothers get to him he is
quite quite dead&mdash;and that shows what it means to
see one of those little blue fires at night in the woods.</p>

<p>"Well, you can believe that Noémi was not very
happy when they brought back that poor Benoît to Pig
Cove. Her eyes were like two brooks, and for a long
time she could not say anything, and then finally, summoning
a little voice of courage:</p>

<p>"'I am glad of one thing,' she said, 'which is that
he had saved all that money, for without it I would
never know how to live through the winter.'</p>

<p>"And one of those brothers said, with an innocent
voice of a dove, 'what money then?'&mdash;and she said,
'He had it with him.' And so they look for it; but no,
there is not any.</p>

<p>"'You must have deceived yourself,' said that
brother. 'I am sure he would have spoken of it if he
had had any money with him; but he said never a word
of such a thing.'</p>

<p>"Now was not that a wicked lie for him to tell? It
is hard to understand how abominable can be some of
those men! But you may be sure they will be punished
for it in the end; and that is what happened to those
four serpents, the Bucherons.</p>

<p>"For listen. The old mother had taken the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and had put it inside a sort of covered bowl, like a
sugar bowl, but there was no sugar in it; and then she
had set this bowl away on a shelf in the cupboard
where they kept the dishes and such things; and the
Bucherons thought it would be safe until the time when
they had something to spend it for in Port l'Évêque;
and they were telling themselves how no one would
ever know what they had done; and they were glad
that the promise they had made to Benoît had not been
heard by anyone but themselves. And so that poor
Noémi was left all alone without man or money; but
sometimes the neighbors would give her a little food;
but for all that those two lambs were often hungry,
and their mother too, when it came bedtime.</p>

<p>"But do you think the Bucherons cared&mdash;those four
hearts of stone? They would not even give her so
much as a crust of dry, mouldy bread; and Noémi was
too proud to go and beg; and beside something seemed
to tell her that there had been a wickedness somewhere,
and that the Bucherons perhaps knew more than they
had told her about that money. So she waited to see
if anything would happen.</p>

<p>"Now one night in December, when all those four
were in the house alone, the beginning of their punishment
arrived, and surely nothing more strange was
ever heard of in this world.</p>

<p>"'Ah, mon Dieu!' cries out the married woman all
of a sudden&mdash;'mon Dieu, what is that!'</p>

<p>"They all looked where she was looking, and what
do you think they saw? There was a chair standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
with three legs in the air, and only the little point of
one on the floor.</p>

<p>"The old woman pushed a scream and jumped to
her feet and went over to it, and with much force set it
back on the floor, the way a chair is meant to stand;
but immediately when she let go of it, there it was
again, as before, all on one leg.</p>

<p>"And then, there cries out the younger woman again,
with a voice shrill as a frightened horse that throws up
its head and then runs away&mdash;'Oh, mère Bucheron,
mère Bucheron,' cries she, 'the chair you were just sitting
in is three legs in air too!'</p>

<p>"And so it was! With that all the family got up in
terror; but no sooner had they done that than at once
all the chairs behaved just like the first, which made
five chairs. These chairs did not seem to move at all,
but stood there on one leg just as if they were always
like that. Those Bucherons were almost dead with
fright, and all four of them fled out of the house as fast
as ever their legs could carry them&mdash;you would have
said sheep chased by a mad dog&mdash;and never stopped
for breath till they reached Gros Nez.</p>

<p>"And pell-mell into old Pierre Leblanc's house all
together, and shaking like ague. Hardly able to talk,
they tell what has happened; and he will not believe
them but says, well, he will go back with them and see.
So he does, and they re-enter the house together, and
look! the chairs are all just as usual.</p>

<p>"'You have been making some crazy dreams,' says
Pierre, rather angry, 'or else,' he says, 'you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
something bad in your hearts.' And with that he goes
home again; and there is nothing more to be told about
that night, though I daresay none of those wicked persons
slept very well.</p>

<p>"But that was only the beginning of what happened
to them during that winter. Sometimes it would be
these knockings about the roof, as of someone with a
great hammer; and again it was as if they had seen a
face at the window&mdash;just an instant, all white, in the
dark&mdash;and then it would be gone. And often, often,
the chairs would be standing as before on one leg. The
table likewise, which once let fall a great crowd of
dishes, and not a few were broken. But worst of all
were these strange sounds that made themselves heard
in the cupboard, like the hand of a corpse going rap&mdash;rap,
rap&mdash;rap&mdash;rap, rap,&mdash;against the lid of its
coffin. You may well believe it was a dreadful fright
for those four infamous ones; but still they would do
nothing, because of their desire to keep all that money
and buy things with it.</p>

<p>"Everybody on the Cape soon knew about what was
happening at the Bucherons', but some pretended it
was to laugh at, saying that such things did not happen
nowadays; and others said the Bucherons must have
gone crazy, and had better be left alone&mdash;and their
arms and legs would sometimes keep jerking a little
when they talked to anyone, as my stepmother told me
a thousand times; and they had a way of looking
behind them&mdash;so!&mdash;as if they were afraid of being
pursued. So however that might be, nobody would go
and see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, things went on like that for quite a while,
and finally, one day in February, through all the snow
that it made on the ground then, that poor Noémi
marched on her feet from Pig Cove to her mother-in-law's,
having left her two infants at a neighbor's; for
she had resolved herself to ask for some help, seeing
that she had had nothing but a little bite since three
days. And when they saw her coming they were taken
with a fright, and at first they were not going to let
her in; but that old snake of a mother, she said:</p>

<p>"'If we refuse to let her in, my children, she will go
and suspect something.'</p>

<p>"So they let her in, and when she was in, they let
her make all her story, or as much as she had breath
for, and then:</p>

<p>"'I am sorry,' said this old snake of a mother, 'that
we cannot possibly do anything for you. Alas, my dear
little daughter, it is barely even if we can manage to
hold soul and body together ourselves, with the terrible
winter it makes these days.'</p>

<p>"And just as she said that, what do you think happened?
A chair got on one leg and went rap&mdash;rap,
rap&mdash;against the floor.</p>

<p>"That Noémi would often be telling about it afterwards
to my stepmother, and she said never of her life
had she seen anything so terrifying. But she did not
scream or do anything like that, because something,
she said, inside her seemed to bid her keep quiet just
then. And she used to tell how that old Bucheron
woman's face turned exactly the color of an oyster on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a white plate, and a trembling took her, and finally she
said, scarcely able to make the sound of the words:</p>

<p>"'Though perhaps&mdash;I might find&mdash;a crust of
bread somewhere that&mdash;that we could spare.'</p>

<p>"That was how she spoke, and at the same instant,
<i>rap</i> went the chair, still on its one leg; and there was a
sound of a hammering on the roof.</p>

<p>"'Or perhaps&mdash;a little loaf of bread and some
potatoes,' said that old Bucheron, while the other
Bucherons sat there without one word, in their chairs,
as if paralyzed, except that their hands kept up a little
shaking motion all the time, like this scour-grass you
get in the marsh, which trembles always even if there
is not any wind. 'Or perhaps a loaf of bread and some
potatoes'&mdash;that is what she was saying, when listen,
there is a knock as of the hand of corpse just inside the
cupboard; and suddenly the two doors fly open&mdash;you
would have said <i>pushed</i> from the inside!</p>

<p>"Noémi crosses herself, but does not say anything,
for she knows it is a time to keep still.</p>

<p>"'And perhaps,' says the old woman then, in a voice
of the most piteous, as if someone were giving her a
pinch, 'and perhaps, if only I had it, a dollar or two to
help buy some medicine and a pair of shoes for that
Évangéline.... But no, I do not think we have so
much as that anywhere in the house.'</p>

<p>"Now was not that like the old serpent, to be telling
a lie even at the last; and surely if God had struck her
dead by a ball of lightning at that moment it would
have been none too good for her. But no, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
going to give her a chance to repent and not to have to
go to Hell for a punishment. So what do you think
He made happen then?</p>

<p>"Hardly had those abominable words jumped out
of her when with a great crash, down off the top shelf
comes that sugar bowl (if it was a sugar bowl), and
as it hits the floor, it breaks into a thousand pieces;
and there, in a little pile, are those thirteen dollars,
just as on the day when that poor Benoît had been carrying
them with him to Port l'Évêque.</p>

<p>"Now just as if they are not doing it at all of their
own wish, but something makes them act that way, all
of a sudden those four Bucherons are kneeling on the
floor, saying their prayers in a strange voice like the
prayers you might hear in a tomb; and with that, the
chair goes back quietly to its four legs, and the noise
ceases on the roof, and those two cupboard doors draw
shut without human hands. As for Noémi, she grabs
up the money, and out she goes, swift as a bird that is
carrying a worm to its children, leaving her parents by
marriage still there on their knees, like so many
images; but as she opens the door she says:</p>

<p>"'May the good God have pity on all the four of
you!'&mdash;which was a Christian thing to say, seeing
how much she had suffered at their hands.</p>

<p>"Well, there is not much more to tell. Noémi got
through the rest of that winter without any more
trouble; and the next year she married a fisherman
from Little Anse, and went away from the Cape. As
for the Bucherons, they were not like the same people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
any more. You would not have known them&mdash;so
pious they were and charitable, though always, perhaps,
a little strange in their ways. But when the old
woman died, two years later, or three, all the people
of Pig Cove and Gros Nez followed the corpse in to
Port l'Évêque; and her grave is there in the cemetery.</p>

<p>"The rest of the family are gone now too, as you
see; and soon, I suppose, there will not be many left,
even out here on the Cape, who know all about what
happened to the Bucherons, because of their hard
hearts; which is a pity, seeing that the story has such a
good lesson to it...."</p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the privileges Michel esteemed most
highly was that of accompanying La Rose
occasionally when she went blueberrying
over on the barrens&mdash;<i>dans les bois</i>, as the
phrase still goes in Port l'Évêque, though it is all of
sixty years since there were any woods there. The
best barrens for blueberrying lay across the harbor.
They reached back to the bay four or five miles to
southward. Along the edges of several rocky coves,
narrow and steep as a sluice, clung a few weatherbeaten
fishermen's houses; but there was no other sign
of human habitation.</p>

<p>It is what they call a bad country over there. Alder
and scrub balsam grow sparsely over the low rocky
hills, where little flocks of sheep nibble all day at the
thin herbage; and from the marshes that lie, green and
mossy, at the foot of every slope, a solitary loon may
occasionally be seen rising into the air with a great
spread of slow wings. A single thread of a road
makes its way somehow across the region, twisting in
and out among the small hills, now climbing suddenly
to a bare elevation, from which the whole sweep of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
sea bursts upon the view, now shelving off along the
side of a knoll of rocks, quickly dipping into some
close hollow, where the world seems to reach no
farther than to the strange sky-line, wheeling sharply
against infinite space.</p>

<p>Two miles back from the inner shore, the road
forks at the base of a little hill more conspicuously
bare than the rest, and close to the naked summit of it,
overlooking all the Cape, stands a Calvary. Nobody
knows how long it has stood there, or why it was first
erected; though tradition has it that long, long ago, a
certain man by the name of Toussaint was there set
upon by wild beasts and torn to pieces. However that
may be, the tall wooden cross, painted black, and bearing
on its center, beneath a rude penthouse, a small
iron crucifix, has been there longer than any present
memory records&mdash;an encouragement, as they say, for
those who have to cross the bad country after dark.</p>

<p>"That makes courage for you," they say. "It is
good to know it is there on the windy nights."</p>

<p>By daylight, however, and especially in the sunshine,
the barrens are quite without other terrors than those
of loneliness; and upon Michel this remoteness and
silence always exercised a kind of spell. He was glad
that La Rose was with him, partly because he would
have been a little afraid to be there quite by himself,
but chiefly because of the imaginative sympathy that at
this time existed so strongly between them. La Rose
could tell him all about the strange things that had
been seen here of winter nights; she herself once, ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ding
a poor old sick woman at Gros Nez, out at the end
of the Cape, had heard the hoofs of the white horse
that gallops across the barrens <i>claquin-claquant</i> in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"It was just there outside the house, pawing the
ground. Almost paralyzed for terror, I ran to the
window and looked out. It was as tall as the church
door,&mdash;that animal,&mdash;all white, and there was no
head to it.</p>

<p>"'Oh, mère Babinot,' I whispered, scarcely able to
make the sound of the words. 'It is as tall as the
church door and all white.'</p>

<p>"She sits up in bed and stares at me like a corpse.
'La Rose,' she says,&mdash;just like that, shrill as a whistle
of wind,&mdash;'La Rose, do you see a head to it?'</p>

<p>"'No, not any!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, mon Dieu, mon Dieu! Then it's sure! It is
the very one, the horse without head!'</p>

<p>"And the next day she took only a little spoonful of
tea, and in two weeks she was dead, poor mère Babinot;
and that's as true as that I made my communion
last Easter. Oh, it's often seen hereabouts, that horse.
It's a sign that something will happen, and never has
it failed yet."</p>

<p>They made their way, La Rose and Michel, slowly
over the low hills, picking the blueberries that grew
thickly in clumps of green close to the ground. La
Rose always wore a faded yellow-black dress, the skirt
caught up, to save it, over a red petticoat; and on her
small brown head she carried the old Acadian <i>mou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>choir</i>,
black, brought up to a peak in front, and knotted
at the side.</p>

<p>She picked rapidly, with her alert, spry movements,
her head always cocked a little to one side, almost
humorously, as she peered about among the bushes for
the best spots. And wherever he was, Michel heard
her chattering softly to herself, in an inconsequential
undertone, now humming a scrap of some pious song,
now commenting on the quality of the berry crop&mdash;never
had she seen so few and so small as these last
years. Surely there must be something to account for
it. Perhaps the birds had learned the habitude of devouring
them&mdash;now addressing some strayed sheep
that had ventured with timid bleats within range:
"Te voilà, petit méchant! Little rogue! What are
you looking about for? Did the others go off and
leave you? Eh bien, that's how it happens, mon
petit. They'll leave you. The world's like that. Eh,
là, là!"</p>

<p>He liked to go to the other side of the hill, out of
sight of her, where he could imagine that he was lost
<i>dans les bois</i>. Then he would listen for her continual
soft garrulity; and if he could not hear it he would
wait quietly for a minute in the silence, feeling a
strange exhilaration, which was almost pain, in the
presence of the great sombre spaces, the immense
emptiness of the overhanging sky, until he could endure
it no longer.</p>

<p>"La Rose!" he would call. "Êtes-vous toujours
là?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mais oui, mon enfant. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It is only that I was thinking."</p>

<p>"The strange child that you are!" she would exclaim.
"You are not like the others."</p>

<p>"La Rose," he would ask, "was it by here that La
Belle Mélanie passed on the night she saw the death
fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by this very spot. She was on her way to Pig
Cove, over beyond the Calvary to the east. It is a
desolate little rat-hole, Pig Cove, nowadays; but then
it was different&mdash;as many as two dozen houses. My
stepmother lived in one of them. Now there are
scarcely six, and falling to pieces at that. La Belle
Mélanie, she was a Boudrot, sister of the Pierre Boudrot
whose son, Théobald, was brother-in-law of stepmother.
That was many years ago. They are all dead
now, or gone away from here&mdash;to Boston, I daresay."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me about that again,&mdash;the <i>feu follet</i>
and Mélanie?"</p>

<p>It was the story Michel liked the best, most of all
when he could sit beside La Rose, on a moss-hummock
of some rough hill on the barrens. Perhaps there
would be cloud shadows flitting like dream presences
across the shining face of the moor. In the distance,
over the backs of the hills that crouched so thickly
about them, he saw the stretch of the ocean, a motionless
floor of azure and purple, flecked, it might be, by
a leaning sail far away; and now and then a gull or
two would fly close over their heads, wheeling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
screaming for a few seconds, and then off again
through the blue.</p>

<p>"S'il vous plaît, tante La Rose, see how many berries
I have picked already!"</p>

<p>The little woman was not difficult of persuasion.</p>

<p>"It was in November," she began. "There had not
been any snow yet; but the nights were cold and terribly
dark under a sky of clouds. That autumn, as my
stepmother often told me, many people had seen the
horse without head as it galloped <i>claquin-claquant</i>
across the barrens. At Gros Nez it was so bad that
no one dared go out after dark, unless it was to run
with all one's force to the neighbors&mdash;but not across
the woods to save their souls. Especially because of
the <i>feu follet</i>.</p>

<p>"Now you must know that the <i>feu follet</i> is of all
objects whatever in the world the most mysterious. No
one knows what it is or when it will come. You might
walk across the barrens every night of your life and
never encounter it; and again it might come upon you
all unawares, not more than ten yards from your own
threshold. It is more like a ball of fire than any other
mortal thing, now large, now small, and always moving.
Usually it is seen first hovering over one of the
marshes, feeding on the poison vapors that rise from
them at night: it floats there, all low, and like a little
luminous cloud, so faint as scarcely to be seen by the
eye. And sometimes people can travel straight by it,
giving no attention, as if they did not know it was
there, but keeping the regard altogether ahead of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
on the road, and the <i>feu follet</i> will let them pass without
harm.</p>

<p>"But that does not happen often, for there are not
many who can keep their wits clear enough to manage
it. It brings a sort of dizziness, and one's legs grow
weak. And then the <i>feu follet</i> draws itself together
into a ball of fire and begins to pursue. It glides over
the hills and flies across the marshes, sometimes in
circles, sometimes bounding from rock to rock, but all
the while stealing a little closer and a little closer, no
matter how fast you run away. And finally&mdash;bff! like
that&mdash;it's upon you&mdash;and that's the end. Death for
a certainty. Not all the medicine in the four parishes
can help you.</p>

<p>"Indeed, there are only two things in all the world
that can save you from the <i>feu follet</i> once it gets after
you. One is, if you are in a state of grace, all your
sins confessed; which does not happen often to the
inhabitants of Pig Cove, for even at this day Père Galland
reproaches them for their neglect. And the other
is, if you have a needle with you. So little a thing as a
needle is enough, incredible as it may seem; for if you
stick the needle upright&mdash;like that&mdash;in an old stump,
the <i>feu follet</i> gets all tangled up in the eye of it. Try
as it will, it cannot free itself; and meanwhile you run
away, and are safe before it reappears. That is why
all the inhabitants of the Cape used to carry a needle
stuck somewhere in their garments, to use on such an
occasion.</p>

<p>"Well, I must tell you about La Belle Mélanie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
That is the name she was known by in all parts, for
she was beautiful as a lily flower, and no lily was ever
more pure and sweet than she. Mélanie lived with her
mother, who was aged almost to helplessness, and she
cared for her with all the tenderness imaginable. You
may believe that she was much sought after by the
young fellows of the Cape&mdash;yes, and of Port l'Évêque
as well, which used to hold its head in the air in those
days; but her mother would hear nothing of her
marrying.</p>

<p>"'You are only seventeen,' she said, 'ma Mélanie.
I will hear nothing of your marrying, no, not for five
years at the least. By that time we shall see.'</p>

<p>"And Mélanie tried to be obedient to all her
mother's commands, difficult as they often were for a
young girl, who naturally desires a little to amuse herself
sometimes. For even had her mother forbidden
her to speak alone to the young men of the neighborhood,
so fearful was she lest her daughter should think
of marriage.</p>

<p>"Eh bien, and so that was how things went for quite
a while, and every day Mélanie grew more beautiful.
And one Saturday afternoon in November she had
been in to Port l'Évêque to make her confession, for
she was a pious girl. And when she went to meet her
companions in order to return to Pig Cove with them,
they said they were not going back that night, for there
was to be a dance at the courthouse, and they were
going to spend the night with some parents by marriage
of theirs. Poor Mélanie! she would have been glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to stay, but alas, her poor mother, aged and helpless,
was expecting her, and she dared not disappoint the
poor soul.</p>

<p>"So finally one of the young men said he would put
her across the harbor, if she did not mind traversing
the woods alone; and she said, no, why should she
mind? It was still plain daylight. And so he put her
across. And she said good-night to him and set off
along the solitary road to the Cape, little imagining
what an adventure was ahead of her.</p>

<p>"For scarcely had she gone so much as a mile when
it had grown almost night, so suddenly at that time of
the year does the daylight extinguish itself. The sky
had grown dark, dark, and there was a look of storm
in it. La Belle Mélanie began to grow uneasy of mind.
And she thought then of the <i>feu follet</i>, and put her
hand to her bodice to assure herself of her needle.
What then! Alas! it was gone, by some accident,
whether or not she had lost it on the road or in the
church.</p>

<p>"With that Mélanie began to feel a terror creep
over her; and this was not lessened, as you may well
believe, when, a few minutes later, she perceived a
floating thing like a luminous cloud in a marsh some
long distance from the road. The night was now all
black; scarcely could she perceive the road ahead,
always winding there among the hills.</p>

<p>"She had the idea of running; but alas, her legs
were like lead; she could not make them march in
front of her. She saw herself already dead. The <i>feu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
follet</i> was beginning to move, first very slowly and all
uncertain, but then drawing itself together into a ball
of fire, and leaping as if in play from one hummock of
moss to another, just as a cat will leave a poor little
mouse half dead on the floor while it amuses itself in
another way.</p>

<p>"What the end would have been, who would have
the courage to say, if just at this moment, all ready to
fall to the ground for terror, poor Mélanie had not
bethought herself of her rosary. It was in her pocket.
She grasped it. She crossed herself. She saluted the
crucifix. And then she commenced to say her prayers;
and with that, wonderful to say, her strength came
back to her, and she began to run. She had never ran
like that before&mdash;swift as a horse, not feeling her legs
under her, and praying with high voice all the time.</p>

<p>"But for all that, the death fire followed, always
faster and faster, now creeping, now flying, now leaping
from rock to rock, and always drawing nearer, and
nearer, with a strange sound of a hissing not of this
world. Mélanie began to feel her forces departing.
She was almost exhausted. She would not be able to
run much more.</p>

<p>"And suddenly, just ahead, on a bare height, there
was the tall Calvaire, and a new hope came to her. If
she could only reach it! She summoned all her strength
and struggled up. She climbs the ascent. Alas,
once more it seems she will fail! There is a fence, as
you know, built of white pales, about the cross. She
had not the power to climb it. She sinks to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
And it was at that last minute, all flat on the ground in
fear of death, that an idea came to her, as I will
tell you.</p>

<p>"She raises herself to her feet by clinging to the
white palings; she faces the <i>feu follet</i>, already not
more than ten yards away; she holds out the rosary,
making the holy sign in the air.</p>

<p>"'I did not make a full confession!' she cries. 'I
omitted one thing. My mother had forbidden me to
have anything to do with a young man; and one day
when I was looking for Fanchette, our cow, who had
wandered in the woods, I met André Babinot, and he
kissed me.'</p>

<p>"That was what saved her. The <i>feu follet</i> rushed
at her with a roar of defeat, and in the same instant it
burst apart into a thousand flames and disappeared.</p>

<p>"As for Mélanie, she fell to the ground again, and
lay there for a while, quite unconscious. At last the
rain came on, and she revived, and set out for home,
but not very vigorously. Ah, mon Dieu! if her poor
mother was glad to see her alive again! She embraced
her most tenderly, and with encouraging voice inquired
what had happened, for Mélanie was still as white as
milk, and there was a strange smell of fire in her garments,
and still she held in her hands the little rosary;
and so finally Mélanie told her everything, not even
concealing the last confession about André, and with
that her mother burst into tears, and said:</p>

<p>"'Mélanie,' she said, 'I have been wrong, me. A
young girl will be a young girl despite all the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
intentions of her mother. To show how grateful to
God I am that you are returned to me safe and sound,
you shall marry André as soon as you like.'</p>

<p>"So they were married the next year. And there is
a lesson to this story, too, which is that one should
always tell the truth; because if La Belle Mélanie had
told all the truth at the beginning she would not have
had all that fright.</p>

<p>"And to show that the story is true, there were
found the marks of flames on the white fence of the
Calvaire the next day; and as often as they painted it
over with whitewash, still the darkness of the scorched
wood would show through, as I often saw for myself;
but now there is a new fence there...."</p>

<h3 title="OF SIMÉON'S SON"><a name="SIMEON" id="SIMEON">LA ROSE WITNESSETH</a></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Of How Old Siméon's Son Came Home Again</i></p>


<div class="figleft dropcap" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i_058.png" width="80" height="80" alt="" />
<div class="caption"></div>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the old cemetery above the church some
men were at work setting up a rather ornate
monument at the head of two long-neglected
and overgrown graves. La Rose had noticed
what was going on, as she came out from early
mass, and had informed herself about it; and since
then, she said, all through the day, her thoughts had
been traveling back to things that happened many
years ago.</p>

<p>"Is it not strange," she observed musingly, sitting
about dusk with Michel on the doorsill of the kitchen,
while Céleste finished the putting-away of the supper
dishes&mdash;"is it not strange how things go in this
world? So often they turn out sorrowfully, and you
cannot understand why that should be so. Think of
that poor Léonie Gilet, who was taken so suddenly in
the chest last winter and died all in a month, and she
one of the purest and sweetest lilies that ever existed,
and the next year she was to be married to a good man
that loved her better than both his two eyes. Ah,
mon Dieu, sometimes I think the sadness comes much
more often than the joy down here."</p>

<p>She looked out broodingly, and with eyes that did
not see anything, across the captain's garden and the
hayfield below, dipping gently to the margin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
harbor. Michel was silent. La Rose's fits of melancholy
interested him even when he only dimly sensed
the burden of them.</p>

<p>"And then," she resumed, after a moment, "sometimes
the ending to things is happy. For a while all
looks dark, dark, and there is grief, perhaps, and some
tears; and then, just at the worst moment&mdash;tiens!&mdash;there
is a change, and the happiness comes again, very
likely even greater than it was at first. It is as if this
good God up there, he could not bear any longer to see
it so heartbreaking, and so he must take things into his
own hands and set them right. And so, sometimes,
when I find myself feeling sad about things, I like to
remember what arrived to that poor Siméon Leblanc,
whose son is just having them place a fine tombstone
for him up there in the cimetière; for if ever happiness
came to any man, it came to him, and that after a
long time of griefs. Did you ever hear about this old
Siméon Leblanc?"</p>

<p>"Never, tante La Rose," answered the boy, gravely.
"But if it has a pleasant ending, I wish you would tell
me about it, and I don't mind if it makes me cry a little
in the middle."</p>

<p>By this, Céleste, the stout domestic, had finished her
kitchen work, and throwing an apron over her stocky
head and shoulders, she clumped out into the yard.</p>

<p>"I am running over to Alec Samson's," she explained,
"to get a mackerel for breakfast, if he caught
any to-day."</p>

<p>The gate clicked after her, and there was a silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
At last La Rose began, a little absently and as if, for
the moment at least, unaware of her auditor....</p>

<p>"This Siméon Leblanc, he lived over there on the
other side of the harbor, just beyond the place where
the road turns off to go to the Cape. My poor stepmother
when coming in to Port l'Évêque to sell some
eggs or berries&mdash;three gallons, say, of blueberries, or
perhaps some of those large strawberries from Pig
Cove&mdash;she would often be running in there for a little
rest and a talk with his wife, Célie&mdash;who always was
glad to see any one, for that matter, the poor soul, for
this Siméon was not too gentle, and often he made her
unhappy with his harsh talk.</p>

<p>"'Ah, mon amie,' she would say to my stepmother,
at the same time wetting her eyes with tears&mdash;'Ah, I
have such a fear, me, that he will do himself a harm,
one day, with the temper he has. He frightens me to
death sometimes&mdash;especially about that Tommy.'</p>

<p>"Now you must understand that this Tommy was
the son they had, and in some ways he resembled to
his father, and in some ways to his mother. For it is
certain he had a pride of the most incredible, which I
daresay made him a little hard to manage; and yet in
his heart there was a softness.</p>

<p>"'That Tommy,' said his mother, 'he wants to be
loved. That is the way to get him to do anything.
There is no use in always punishing him and treating
him hardly.'</p>

<p>"But for all that, old Siméon must have his will,
and so he does not cease to be scolding the boy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
commands him now to do this thing, now that&mdash;here,
there. He forbids him to be from home at night. He
tells him he is a disgrace of a son to be so little
laborious. Oh, it was a horror the way that poor lamb
of a Tommy was treated; and finally, one day, when
he was seventeen or eighteen, there was a great quarrel,
and that Siméon called him by some cruel name,
and white as a corpse cries out Tommy:</p>

<p>"'My father, that is not true. You shall not say
it!'&mdash;and the other, furious as an animal: 'I shall say
what I choose!' And he says the same thing again.
And Tommy: 'After that, I will not endure to stay
here another day. I am tired of being treated so.
You will not have another chance.'</p>

<p>"And with that he places a kiss on the forehead of
his poor mother, who was letting drop some tears, and
walks out of the house without so much as turning his
head again; and he marches over to Petit Ingrat,
where there was an American fisherman which had
put in for some bait, and he says to the captain: 'Will
you give me a place?' and the captain says, 'We are
just needing another man. Yes, we will give you a
place.' So this Tommy, he got aboard, and a little
later they put out and went off to the Banks for the
fish.</p>

<p>"Well, it was not very long before that Siméon got
over his bad wicked rage; and then he was sorry
enough for what he had done, especially because there
was no longer any son in the house, and that poor
Célie must always be grieving herself after him. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
you may believe that Siméon got little pity from the
neighbors.</p>

<p>"'It is good enough for him,' they would say&mdash;'a
man like that, who is not decent to his own son.'</p>

<p>"But they were sorry for Célie, most of all when
she began to grow thinner and thinner and had a
strange look in her eyes that was not entirely of this
world. The old man said, 'She will be all right again
when that schooner comes back,' and he was always
going over to Petit Ingrat to find out if it had returned
yet; but you see, of course there would not be any need
of bait when the season was finished, and so the
schooner did not put in at all; and the autumn came,
and went by, and then followed the winter, and still no
news, but only waiting and waiting, and a little before
Easter that poor Célie went away among the angels. I
think her heart was quite broken in two, and it did not
seem to her that she needed to stay any longer in this
hustling world. And so they buried her in the old
cimetière&mdash;I saw her grave to-day, next to Siméon's,
and this fine new monument is to be for the two of
them; but for all these years there has been just a
wooden cross there, like the other graves.</p>

<p>"But still no word came of Tommy, and the old
Siméon was all alone in the house. Oh, I can remember
him well, well, although I was only a young tiny
girl then and had not had any sorrow myself. We
would see him walking along the Petit Ingrat road, all
bent over and trailing one leg a little.</p>

<p>"'Hst!' one of my companions would whisper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
'that is old Siméon, who drove his son from home;
and his poor wife is dead with grief. He is going
across there to see if a schooner will have come in yet
with any news.'</p>

<p>"And that was true. He took this habitude of making
a promenade almost every day to Petit Ingrat during
that season of the year when the Americans are
going down to the fish&mdash;là-bas&mdash;and if there was a
schooner in the harbor, he finds the captain or one of
the crew, and he says, 'Is it, m'sieu, for example, that
you have seen a boy anywhere named Tommy Leblanc?
It is my son&mdash;you understand?&mdash;a very
pretty young boy, with black hair and fine white teeth
and a little curly mustache&mdash;so&mdash;just beginning to
sprout.' And he would go on to describe that Tommy,
but of course, for one thing they could not understand
his French very well, for the Americans, as you know,
do not speak that language among themselves; and
anyway, you may depend that none of them had ever
heard of Tommy Leblanc; and sometimes they would
have a little mockery of the old man; and sometimes,
on the contrary, they would feel pity, and would say,
well, God's name, it was a damage, but they could not
tell him anything.</p>

<p>"And then the old man would say, 'Well, if ever you
should see him anywhere, will you please tell him that
his father is wanting him to come home, if he will be
so kind as to do it; because it is very lonesome without
him, and the mother is dead.'</p>

<p>"Then after he had said that, he would go back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
again along the road to the Cape, not speaking to anybody
unless they spoke to him first, and trailing one
leg after him a little, like one of these horses you see
sometimes with a weight tied to a hind foot so that it
cannot run away&mdash;or at least not very far. That is
how I remember old Siméon from the time when I was
a little girl&mdash;walking there along the road to or from
Petit Ingrat. I used to hear people say: 'Ah, my God,
how old he is grown all in these few years! He is not
the same man&mdash;so quiet and so timid'&mdash;and others:
'But can one say how it is possible for him to live there
all alone like that?'&mdash;and someone replied: 'You
could not persuade him to live anywhere else, for that
is where he has all his memories, both the good and
the bad, and what else is left for him now&mdash;that, and
the crazy idea he has that his Tommy will one day
come home again?'</p>

<p>"You see, as the years passed, everybody took the
belief that Tommy must be dead, at sea or somewhere,
seeing that not one word was heard of him; but of
course they guarded themselves well from saying anything
like that to poor old Siméon.</p>

<p>"Well, it was about the time when your poor father,
Amédée, was a boy of your age, or a little older, that
all this sorrow came to an end; and this is the pleasant
part of the story. I was living at Madame
Paon's then, down near the post-office wharf, and we
had the habitude of looking out of the window every
day when the packet-boat came in (which was three
times a week) to see if anybody would be landing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Port l'Évêque. Well, and one afternoon whom should
we see but a fine m'sieu with black beard, carrying a
cane, dressed like an American; and next, a lovely lady
in clothes of the most fashionable and magnificent;
and then, six beautiful young children, all just as handsome
as dolls, and holding tightly one another by the
hand, with an affection the most charming in the world.
Ah, ma foi, if I shall ever forget that sight!</p>

<p>"And Madame Paon to me: 'Rose,&mdash;La Rose,&mdash;in
God's name, who can they be! Perhaps some millionaires
from Boston&mdash;for look, the trunks that they
have!'</p>

<p>"And that was the truth, for the trunks and bags
were piled all over the wharf; and opening the window
a little, we hear m'sieu giving directions to have them
taken to the Couronne d'Or&mdash;'and who,' he asks in
French, 'is the proprietor there now?'&mdash;and they
say: 'Gaston Lebal'&mdash;and he says: 'What! Gaston
Lebal! Is it possible!'</p>

<p>"'He knows Port l'Évêque, it seems,' says Madame
Paon, all excitement; and just then the first two trunks
go by the windows, and she tells me, 'It is an English
name, or an American.' And then, spelling out the
letters, for she reads with a marvel of ease, she says,
'W-H-I-T-E is what the trunks say on them; but I can
make nothing out of that. I am going outside, me,'
she says, 'and perhaps I shall learn something.'</p>

<p>"She descends into the garden, and seems to be
working a little at the flowers, and a minute later, here
comes the fine m'sieu, and he looks at her for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
instant&mdash;right in the face, so, and as if asking a question&mdash;and
then: 'Ah, mon Dieu, it is Suzon Boudrot!'
he cries, using the name she was born with. 'Can you
not remember me?&mdash;That Tommy Leblanc who ran
away twenty years ago?'</p>

<p>"Madame Paon gives a scream of joy, and they
embrace; and then he presents this Mees W'ite, qui est
une belle Américaine, and then he says: 'What is there
of news about my dear mother and my father?'&mdash;and
she: 'Did you not know your poor mother was dead
the year after you went!'&mdash;and he: 'Ma mère&mdash;she
is dead?'&mdash;and the tears jump out of his eyes, and his
voice trembles as if it had a crack in it. 'Well, she is
with the blessed angels, then,' says he.</p>

<p>"'But your poor old father,' goes on Madame
Paon, 'he is still waiting for you every day. He has
waited all these twenty years for you to come back.'</p>

<p>"'He is still in the old place?' asks he.</p>

<p>"'Yes, he would not leave it.'</p>

<p>"'We shall go over there at once,' he says, opening
out his two arms&mdash;so!&mdash;'before ever we set foot in
another house. It is my duty as a son.'</p>

<p>"So while André Gilet&mdash;the father of that dear
Léonie who was taken in the chest&mdash;while he is getting
the boat ready to cross the harbor, Tommy tells
her how he has been up there in Boston all these years&mdash;at
a place called Shee-cahgo, a big city&mdash;and has
been making money; and how he changed his name to
W'ite, which means the same as Leblanc and is more in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the mode; and how he married this lovely Américaine,
whose name was Finnegan, and had all these sweet
little children; but always, he said, he had desired to
make a little visit at home, only it was so far to come;
and he was afraid that his father would still be angry
at him.</p>

<p>"'Ah,' says Madame Paon, with emotion, 'you will
not know your father. He is so different: just as mild
as a sheep. Everyone has come to love him.' ...</p>

<p>"Now for the rest of the story, all I know is what
that André told us, for he put all this family across
to the other side in his boat. So when they reached
the shore, M'sieu Tommy, he says: 'You will all wait
here until I open the door and beckon: and then you,
Maggie, will come up; and then, a little later, we will
have the children in, all together.'</p>

<p>"And with that he leaves them, and goes up to the
old house, and knocks, and opens the door, and walks
in&mdash;and who can say the joy and the comfort of the
meeting that happened then? And quite a long while
passed, André said; and that lovely lady sat there on
the side of the boat, all as white as milk, and never
saying a word; and those six lambs, whispering softly
among themselves&mdash;and one of them said, just a
little above its breath:</p>

<p>"'It will be nice to have a grandpa all for ourselves,
don't you think?'&mdash;and was not that a dear sweet
little thing for it to say?...</p>

<p>"And finally the door opens again, and see! and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
hand makes a sign; and that lady, swift as one of these
sea-gulls, leaps ashore. And up the hill; and through
the gate; and into the house! And the door shuts
again.</p>

<p>"And another wait, while those six look at each
other, and say their little things. And at last they are
called too, and away they go, all together, just like one
of these flocks of curlew that fly over the Cape, making
those soft little sounds; and then into the house;
and André said he had to wipe two tears out of his
eyes to see a thing like that.</p>

<p>"Well, this was the end of old Siméon's grief, as
you may well believe. Those W'ites stay at the Couronne
d'Or for as much as nine or ten days, and every
morning they will be going across to see their dear
dear grandfather; and finally when they went away,
they had hired that widow Bergère to keep his house
comfortable for him; and M'sieu Tommy left money
for all needs.</p>

<p>"And every Christmas after that, so long as old
Siméon existed, there would come boxes of presents
from that place in Boston. Oh, I assure you, he did
not lack that good care. And always he must be talking
about that Tommy of his, who was so rich, and
was some great personage in the city&mdash;what they
called an alderman&mdash;and yet he had not forgotten his
poor old father, who had waited all those years to see
him.</p>

<p>"So this story shows that sometimes things turn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
just as well in this life down here as they do in those
silly stories they tell you about princesses and all those
things that are not so; and that is a comfort sometimes,
when you see so much that is sad and heartbreaking
in this world...."</p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>o-day I can think about only one thing. It
is in vain I have tried to busy myself with
my sermon for next Sunday. Last week, for
another reason, I had recourse to an old sermon;
but I dislike to make a practice of so doing, even
though I strongly suspect that none of our little Salmon
River congregation would know the difference. We
are a very simple people, in this out-of-the-way Cape
Breton parish, called mostly to be fishers, like Our
Lord's apostles, and recking not a whit of the finer
points of doctrine. Nevertheless, it is an hireling
shepherd who is faithless only because the flock do not
ask to be fed with the appointed manna; and I shall
broach the sermon again, once I have set down the
thing that is so heavy on my heart.</p>

<p>For all I can think of just now is that Renny and
Suse, out there on Halibut Head, four miles away, are
alone; alone for the first time in well-nigh thirty years.
The last of the brood has taken wing.</p>

<p>Yet it came to me this morning, as I watched Renny
on the wharf saying good-by to the boy, and bidding
him wrap the tippet snug about his neck in case the
wind would be raw&mdash;it came to me that there is a
triumph about the nest when it is empty that it could
never have earlier. I saw the look of it in Renny's
face&mdash;not defeat, but exultation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what are you going to do now, Renny?" I
asked him, as the steamer slipped out of sight behind
the lighthouse rock.</p>

<p>He stared at me a little contemptuously, a manner
he has always had.</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i>, Mr. Biddles?" says he, with a queer laugh.
"Why, what <i>would</i> I do, sor? They ain't no less fish
to be catched, is they, off Halibut Head, just because I
got quit of a son or two?"</p>

<p>He left me, with a toss of his crisp, tawny-gray curls,
jumped into his little two-wheeled cart, and was off.
And I thought, "Ah, Renny Marks, outside you are
still the same wild beast as when I had my first meeting
with you, two-and-thirty years ago; but inside&mdash;yes,
I knew then it must come; and it was not for me to
order the how of it."</p>

<p>So as I took my way homeward, alone, toward the
Rectory, I found myself recalling, as if it were yesterday,
the first words I had ever exchanged with that
tawny giant, just then in his first flush of manhood,
and with a face as ruddy and healthy-looking as one of
these early New Rose potatoes. Often, to be sure, I
had seen him already in church, of a Sunday, sitting
defiant and uncomfortable on one of the rear benches,
struggling vainly to keep his eyes open; but before the
last Amen was fairly out of the people's mouth, he had
always bolted for the door; and I had never come, as
you may say, face to face with him until this afternoon
when I was footing it back, by the cove road,
from a visit to an old sick woman, Nannie Odell. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
here comes Renny Marks on his way home from the
boat; and over his shoulder was the mainsail and gaff
and a mackerel-seine and two great oars; and by one
arm he had slung the rudder and tackle and bait-pot;
and under the other he lugged a couple of bundles of
lath for to mend his traps; and so he was pacing along
there as proud and careless as Samson bearing away
the gates of Gaza on his back (<i>Judges</i> xvi, 3).</p>

<p>Now I had entertained the belief for some time that
it was my duty, should the occasion offer, to have a
serious word with Renny about matters not temporal;
and this was clearly the moment. Yet even before we
had met he gave me one of those proud, distrustful, I
have said contemptuous, looks of his; and I seemed
suddenly to perceive the figure I must cut in his eyes,
pattering along there so trimly in my clerical garb, and
with my book of prayers under one arm; and, do you
know, I was right tongue-tied; and so we came within
hand-reach, and still never a word.</p>

<p>At last, "Good-day to ye, Mister Biddles," says he,
with a scant, off-hand nod; and, as if he knew I must
be admiring of his strength, "I can fetch twice this
load, sor," says he, "without so mucht as knowing the
difference."</p>

<p>"It's a fine thing, Renny Marks," said I, gaining my
tongue again, at his boast, "a fine thing to be the
strongest man in three parishes, if that's what ye be, as
they tell me."</p>

<p>"It is that, sor," says he. "I never been cast yet;
and I don't never expect for to be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's still finer a thing, Renny," I went on, "to
use that strength in the honor of your Maker. Tell
me, do you remember to say your prayers every night
before you go to bed?"</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the horse-laugh the young fellow
had at those words.</p>

<p>"Why, sor," he exclaimed, as if I had suggested the
most unconscionable thing in the world, "saying prayers!
that's for the likes of them as wash their face
every day. I say my prayers on Sunday; and that's
enough for the likes of me!"</p>

<p>And with that, not even affording me a chance to
reply, he strode off up the beach road; and in every
movement of his great limbs I seemed to see the pride
and glory of life. Doubtless I was to blame for not
pressing home to him more urgently at that moment
the claims of religion; but as I stood there, watching
him, it came to me that after all he was almost to be
pardoned for being proud. For surely there is something
to warm the heart in the sight of the young lion's
strength and courage; and even the Creator, I thought,
must have taken delight in turning out such a fine piece
of mortal handiwork as that Renny Marks.</p>

<p>But with that thought immediately came another:
"Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth
every son whom he receiveth" (<i>Hebrews</i> xii, 6). And
I went home sadly, for I seemed to see that Renny had
bitter things ahead of him before he should learn the
great lesson of life.</p>

<p>Well, and this is the way it came to him. At the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of four-and-twenty, he married this Suse Barlow from
down the coast a piece,&mdash;Green Harbor was the name
of the town,&mdash;and she was a sweet young thing, gentle
and ladylike, though of plainest country stock, and
with enough education so they'd let her keep school
down there. He built a little house for her, the one
they still live in, with his own hands, at Halibut Head;
and I never saw anything prettier than the way that
young giant treated his wife&mdash;like a princess! It was
the first time in his life, I dare say, he had ever given
a thought to anything but himself; and in a fashion, I
suppose, 'twas still but a satisfaction of his pride, to
have her so beautiful, and so well-dressed.</p>

<p>I remember of how often they would come in late to
church,&mdash;even as late as the Te Deum,&mdash;and I could
almost suspect him of being behindhand of purpose,
for of course every one would look around when he
came creaking down the aisle in his big shoes, with a
wide smile on his ruddy face that showed all his white
teeth through his beard; and none could fail to observe
how fresh and pretty Suse was, tripping along there
behind him, and looking very demure and modest in
her print frock, and oh, so very, very sorry to be late!
And during the prayers I had to remark how his face
would always be turned straight toward her, as if it
were to her he was addressing his supplications; the
young heathen!</p>

<p>Now there is one thing I never could seem to understand,
though I have often turned it over in my mind,
and that is, why it should be that a young Samson like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Renny Marks, and a fine, bouncing girl like that Suse
of his, should have children who were too weak and
frail to stay long on this earth; but such was the case.
They saved only three out of six; and the oldest of
those three, Michael John, when he got to be thirteen
years of age, shipped as cabin boy on a fisherman down
to the Grand Banks, and never came back. So that
left only Bessie Lou, who was twelve, and little Martin,
who was the baby.</p>

<p>If ever children had a good bringing up, it was those
two. I never saw either of them in a dirty frock or in
bare feet; and that means something, you must allow,
when you consider the hardness of the fisherman's life,
and how often he has nothing at all to show for a season's
toil except debts! But work&mdash;I never saw any
one work like that Renny; and he made a lovely little
farm out there; and Suse wasn't ashamed to raise
chickens and sell them in Salmon River; and she dyed
wool, and used to hook these rugs, with patterns of her
own design, baskets of flowers, or handsome fruit-dishes;
and almost always she could get a price for
them. But, as you may believe, she couldn't keep her
sweet looks with work like that. Before she was
thirty she began to look old, as is so often true in a
hard country like ours; and not often would she be
coming in to church any more, because, she said, of the
household duties; but my own belief is that she did not
have anything to wear. But Bessie Lou and little
Martin, when the boy was well enough, were there
every fine Sunday, as pretty as pictures, and able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
recite the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer, and the Collects,
and the Commandments, quite like the children
of gentlefolk.</p>

<p>Well, when Bessie Lou got to be sixteen, she took it
into her head that she must go off to Boston, where she
would be earning her own living, and see something
more of the world than is possible for a girl in Salmon
River. Our girls all get that notion nowadays; they
are not content to stay at home as girls used to do; but
off they go in droves to the States, where wages are
big, and there is excitement and variety. So the old
people finally said yes, and off goes Bessie Lou, like the
others; and in two years we heard she was to be married
to a mechanic in Lynn (I think that is the name of
the city) somewhere outside of Boston. She has been
gone eight years now, and has three children; and she
writes occasionally. She is always wishing she could
come down and visit the old folks; but it is hard to get
away, I presume, and they are plain working people.</p>

<p>So after Bessie Lou's going, all they had left at
home was Martin, who was always ailing more or less.
And on my word, I never saw anything like the care
they gave that boy. There wasn't anything too good
for him. All these most expensive tonics and patent
medicines they would be for trying, one after another,
and telling themselves every time that at last they had
found just the right thing, because he'd seem to be
bracing up a bit, and getting more active. And then
he would take another of his bad spells, and lose
ground again; and they would put by that bottle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
try something else. One day when I was out there his
ma showed me all of twenty bottles of patent medicine,
some of them scarcely touched, that Renny had got for
him, one time or another.</p>

<p>You see, Martin couldn't run about outdoors very
much because of his asthma; and then, his eyes being
bad, that made him unhappy in the house, for he
couldn't be reading or studying. His father got him
an old fiddle once, he'd picked up at an auction, and
the boy took to it something wonderful; but not having
any teacher and no music he soon grew tired of it. And
whenever old Renny would be in the village, he must
always be getting some little thing to take out to Martin:
a couple of bananas, say, or a jack-knife, or one of
those American magazines with nice pictures, especially
pictures of ships and other sailing craft, of which the
lad was very fond.</p>

<p>Well, and so last winter came, which was a very bad
winter indeed, in these parts; and the poor lamb had a
pitiful hard time; and whenever Renny got in to
church, it was plain to see that he was eating his heart
out with worry. He still had his old way of always
snoring during the sermon; but oh, if you could see
once the tired, anxious, supplicating look in his face,
as soon as his proud eyes shut, you never would have
had the heart to wish anything but "Sleep on now, and
take your rest" (<i>Mark</i> xiv, 41), for you knew that
perhaps, for a few minutes, he had stopped worrying
about that little lad of his.</p>

<p>Spring came on, at last, and Martin was out again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
for a while every day in the sun; and sometimes
the old man would be taking him abroad for a drive
or for a little sail in the boat, when he was going out
to his traps; and it appeared that the strain was over
again for the time being. That is why I was greatly
surprised and troubled one day, about two months ago,
to see Renny come driving up toward the Rectory like
mad, all alone in his cart.</p>

<p>I had just been doing a turn of work myself at the
hay; for it is hard to get help with us when you need it
most; and as I came from the barn, in my shirt-sleeves,
Renny turned in at the gate.</p>

<p>"Something has happened to the boy," was my
thought; and I was all but certain of it when I saw the
man's face, sharp set as a flint stone, and all the blood
gone from his ruddy skin so that it looked right blue.
He jumped out before the mare stopped, and came up
to me.</p>

<p>"Can I have a word with ye?" said he; and when
he saw my look of question, he added, "It ain't nothink,
sor. He's all right."</p>

<p>I put my hand on his shoulder, and led him into my
study, and we sat down there, just as we were, I in my
shirt-sleeves, and still unwashed after the hayfield.</p>

<p>"What is it, Renny, man?" says I.</p>

<p>It seemed like he could not make his lips open for a
moment, and then, suddenly, he began talking very fast
and excitedly, pecking little dents in the arms of the
chair with his big black fingernails.</p>

<p>"That Bessie Lou of oors up to Boston," said he, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
if he were accusing some one of an outrage, "we got a
letter from 'er last night, we did, and she sayse, says
she, why wouldn't we be for a-sending o' the leetle lad
up theyr? They'd gladly look oot for him, she sayse;
and the winter ain't severe, she sayse; and he could go
to one o' them fine city eye-doctors and 'ave his eyes
put right with glasses or somethink; and prob'ly he
could be for going to school again and a-getting of his
learning, which he's sadly be'indhand in, sor, becaust
he's ben ailing so much."</p>

<p>His eyes flashed, and the sweat poured down his
forehead in streams.</p>

<p>I don't know why I was so slow to understand; but
I read his look wrong, there seemed so much of the old
insolence and pride in it, and I replied, I daresay a
little reproachfully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, and why wouldn't that be an excellent thing,
Renny? I should think you would feel grateful."</p>

<p>He stared at me for a second, as if I had struck him.
Ah, we can forget the words people say to us, even in
wrath; but can we ever free ourselves from the memory
of such a look? Without knowing why, I had the
feeling of being a traitor. And then, all of a sudden,
there he had crumpled down in his chair, and put his
head in his big hands, and was sobbing.</p>

<p>"I cain't&mdash;I cain't let him go," he groaned. "I
woon't let him go. He's all what we got left."</p>

<p>I sat there for a time, helpless, looking at him. You
might think that a priest, with the daily acquaintance
he has with the bitter things of life, ought to know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to face them calmly; but so far as my own small experience
goes, I seem to know nothing more about all
that than at the beginning. It always hurts just as
much; it's always just as bewildering, just as terrible,
as if you had never seen anything like it before. And
when I saw that giant of a Renny Marks just broken
over there like some big tree shattered by lightning, it
seemed as if I could not bear to face such suffering.
Then I remembered that he had been committed into
my care by God, and that I must not be only an hireling
shepherd. So I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Renny, lad, it isn't for ourselves we must be thinking.
It's for him."</p>

<p>He lifted up his head, with the shaggy, half-gray
hair all rumpled on his wet forehead, and pulled his
sleeve across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hark'e, Mister Biddles," he commanded harshly.
"Ain't we did the best we could for him? Who dares
say we ain't did the best we could for him? <i>You?</i>"</p>

<p>I made no answer, and for a minute we faced each
other, while he shook his clenched fists at me, and the
creature in him that had never yet been cast challenged
all the universe.</p>

<p>"They're tryin' to tak my boy away from me," he
roared, "and they cain't do it&mdash;I tell you they cain't.
He's all what we got left, now."</p>

<p>"And so you mean to keep him for yourself?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Ay, that I do," he cried, jumping out of his chair,
and striding up and down the room as if clean out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
his wits. "I do! I do! Why <i>wouldn't</i> I mean to, hey?
Ain't he mine? Who's got a better right to him?"</p>

<p>Of a sudden he comes to a dead halt in front of me,
with his arms crossed. "Mister Biddles," he says,
very bitterly, "you may well be thankfu' you never
wast a father yoursel'. Nobody ain't for trying to tak
nothink away from you."</p>

<p>"That's quite true, Renny," said I. "But remember,"
I said, not intending any irreverence, but uttering
such poor words as were given to me in my extremity,
"remember, Renny, it's to a Father you say your prayers
in church every Sunday; and you needn't think as
that Father doesn't know full as well as you what it is
to give up an only Son for love's sake."</p>

<p>"Hey?&mdash;What's that, sor?" cries Renny, with a
face right like a dead thing.</p>

<p>"And would He be asking of you for to let yours go,
if He didn't know there was love enough in your heart
to stand the test?"</p>

<p>Renny broke out with a terrible groan, like the roar
of anguish of a wild beast that has got a mortal
wound; and the same instant the savage look died in
his eyes, and the bigger love in him had triumphed
over the smaller love. I could see it, I knew it, even
before he spoke. He caught at my hand, blunderingly,
and gave it a twist like a winch.</p>

<p>"He shall go, sor. He shall go for all of I. And
Mr. Biddles, while I'm for telling the old woman and
the boy, would ye be so condescending as to say over
some of them there prayers, so I could have the feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>ing,
as you might say, that some one was keeping an
eye on me? It'll all be done in less nor a half-hour."</p>

<p>And with that, off he goes, and jumps into his cart,
and whips up the mare, tearing down the road like a
whirlwind, just as he had come, without so much as
saying good-by. And the next day I heard them saying
in the village that Renny Marks's boy was to go up to
the States to be raised with his sister's family.</p>

<p>Ah, well, that's only a common sort of a story, I
know. The same kind of things happen near us every
day. I can't even quite tell why I wanted to set it down
on paper like this, only that, some way, it makes me
believe in God more; even when I have to remember,
and it seems to me just now like I could never stop
remembering it, that Renny and Suse are all alone to-day
out there on Halibut Head. Renny is at the fish,
of course; and Suse, I daresay, is working in her little
potato patch; and Martin is out there on the sea, being
borne to a world far away, and from which, I suppose,
he will not be very anxious to return; for few of them
do come back, nowadays, to the home country.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>ven Zabette, with her thousand wrinkles,
was young once. They say her lips were
red as wild strawberries and her hair as
sleek as the wing of a blackbird in spring.
All the old people of St. Esprit remember how she
used to swing along the street on her way to mass of a
Sunday, straight, proud, agile as a goat, with her dark
head flung back, and a disdainful smile on her lips that
kept young men from being unduly forward. The
country people, who must have their own name for
everything and everybody, used to call her "la belle
orgueilleuse," and sometimes, "the highstepper"; and
though they had to laugh at her a little for her lofty
ways, they found it quite natural to address her as
mademoiselle.</p>

<p>But all these things one only knows by hearsay. Zabette
does not talk much herself. So far as she is concerned,
you might never guess that she had a story at
all. She lives there in the little dormer-windowed cottage
beyond the post-office with Suzanne Benoît. For
thirty-three years now the two women have lived together;
and it is the earnest prayer of both of them
that when the time for going arrives, they may go
together.</p>

<p>These two good souls have the reputation, all over
the country, of immense industry and thrift. Suzanne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
keeps three cows, and her butter is famous. Zabette&mdash;she
was a Fuseau, from the Grande Anse&mdash;takes
in washing of the better class. Nobody in St. Esprit can
do one of those stiff white linen collars so well as she.
Positively, it shines in the sun like a looking-glass. If
you notice the men going to church, you can always
pick out those who have their shirts and collars done
by Zabette Fuseau. By comparison, the others appear
dull and very commonplace.</p>

<p>"But why must Zabette do collars for her living?"
you are asking. "Why has she not a man of her own
to look out for her, and half a dozen grown up children?
Did she never marry, then&mdash;this belle orgueilleuse?"</p>

<p>No. Never. But not on account of that pride of
hers; at least not directly. If you go into the pretty
little living-room of the second cottage beyond the
post-office&mdash;the one with such a show of geraniums in
the front windows&mdash;you will guess half the secret, for
just above the mantelpiece, between two vases of artificial
asters, hangs the daguerreotype portrait of a
young man in mariner's slops. The lineaments have
so faded with the years that it is difficult to make them
out with any assurance. It is as if the portrait itself
were seeking to escape from life, retreating little by
little, imperceptibly, into the dull shadows of the
ground, so that only as you look at it from a certain
angle can you still clearly distinguish the small dark
eyes, the full moustache, the round chin, the square
stocky shoulders of the subject. Only the two rosy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
spots added by the daguerreotypist to the cheeks defy
time and change, indestructible token of youth and
ardor.</p>

<p>A little frame of immortelles encloses the portrait.
And directly in front of it, on the mantelpiece, stands
a pretty shell box, with the three words on the mother-of-pearl
lid: "À ma chérie." What is in the box&mdash;if
anything&mdash;no one can tell you for a certainty, though
there are plenty of theories. "Love letters," say
some; and others, with a pitying laugh, "Old maid's
tears."</p>

<p>Zabette and Suzanne hold their tongues. I think I
know what the treasure of the box is; for I had the
story directly from a very aged woman who knew both
the "girls" when they were young; and she vouched
for the truth of it by all the beads of her rosary. This
is how it went.</p>

<p>Zabette Fuseau was eighteen, and she lived at the
Grand Anse, two miles out of St. Esprit; and the procession
of young fellows, going there to woo, was like
a pilgrimage, exactly. Among them came one from
far down the coast, a place called Rivière Bourgeoise.
He was a deep sea fisherman, from off a vessel which
had put in at St. Esprit for repairs, mid-course to the
Grand Banks; and on his first shore leave Maxence
had caught sight of la belle orgueilleuse, who had come
into town with a basket of eggs; and he had followed
her home, at a little distance, sighing, but without the
courage to address her so long as they were in the village.
He was a very handsome young fellow, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
brown, ruddy skin, and the most beautiful dark curly
hair and crisp moustache imaginable.</p>

<p>Zabette knew he was behind her; but she would not
turn; not she; only walked a little more proudly and
gracefully, with that swinging movement of hers, like
a vessel sailing in a head wind. At last, when they had
reached the Calvaire at the end of the village, he managed
to get out his first word.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried, haltingly. "Mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>She turned half about and fixed her dark proud eyes
upon him, while her cheeks crimsoned.</p>

<p>"Well, m'sieur?"</p>

<p>He could not speak, and the two stared at each other
for a long time in silence, while the thought came to
her that this was the man for whom she was destined.</p>

<p>"Had you something to say to me?" she repeated,
finally, in a tone that tried to be severe, but was really
very soft.</p>

<p>He nodded his curly head, and licked his lips hard
to moisten them.</p>

<p>"I cannot wait any longer," she protested, after a
while. "They need me at home."</p>

<p>She turned quickly again, as if to go; but her feet
were glued to the ground, and she did not take a step.</p>

<p>"Oh, s'il vous plaît, mam'selle!" he cried, to hold
her. "You think I am rude. But I did not mean to
follow you like this. I could not help it. You are so
beautiful."</p>

<p>The look he gave her with those words sank deep
into her heart and rooted itself there forever. In vain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
for the rest of her life, she might try to tear it out;
there was a fatality about it. Zabette, fine highstepper
that she was, had been caught at last. She knew that
she ought to send the handsome young sailor away;
but her tongue would not obey her. Instead, it uttered
some very childish words of confusion and pleasure;
and before she knew it, there was her man walking
along at her side, with one hand on his heart, declaring
that she was the most angelic creature in the world,
that he was desperately in love with her, that he could
not live without her, and that she must promise then
and there to be his, or he would instantly kill himself.
The burning, impassioned look in his eyes struck her
with dismay.</p>

<p>"But I cannot decide all in a moment like this," she
protested, in a weak voice. "It would be indecent. I
must think."</p>

<p>"Think!" he retorted, bitterly. "Oh, very well.
Then you do not love me!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but I do!" she cried, all trembling.</p>

<p>With that he took her in his arms and kissed her,
and nothing more was heard about suicide or any such
subject.</p>

<p>"But we must not tell any one yet," she pleaded.
"They would not understand."</p>

<p>He agreed, with the utmost readiness. "We will
not tell a soul. It shall be exactly as you wish. But
I may come and see you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," she responded. "Often,&mdash;that is,
every day or two,&mdash;at Grande Anse; and perhaps we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
may happen to meet sometimes in the village, as well."</p>

<p>"The <i>Soleil</i> will be delaying at St. Esprit for two
weeks," he explained, as they walked along, hand in
hand. "She put in for some repairs. By the end of
that time, perhaps"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not so soon as that," she interrupted.
"We must let a longer while pass first."</p>

<p>She gazed at him yearningly. "You will be returning
by here in the autumn, at the end of the season on
the Banks?"</p>

<p>"We are taking on three men from St. Esprit," he
answered. "We shall stop here on the return to set
them ashore. That will be in October, near the end of
the month, if the season is good."</p>

<p>She sighed, as if dreading some disaster; and they
looked at each other again, and the look ended in a
kiss. It is not by words, that new love feeds and
grows.</p>

<p>Before they reached the Grande Anse he quitted
her; but he gave her his promise to come again that
evening. He did&mdash;that evening, and two evenings
later, and so on, every other evening for those two
weeks. Zabette's old mother took a great fancy to
him, and gave him every encouragement; but the old
père Fuseau, who had sailed many a voyage, in
younger days, round the Horn, would never speak a
good word for him&mdash;and perhaps his hostility only
increased the girl's attachment.</p>

<p>"A little grease is all very well for the hair of a
young man," he would say. "But this scented
pomade they use nowadays&mdash;pah!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"You object then to a sailor's being a gentleman?"
demanded the girl haughtily.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," roared the old père Fuseau. "Have a
care, Zabette."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the two lovers found plenty of chances
to be alone together; and they would talk, in low
voices, of their happiness and of the future, which
looked very bright to Zabette, despite all the uncertainties
of the sea.</p>

<p>"When we put in on the return from the Banks,"
said Maxence, "you will be at the wharf to meet me;
and that very day we will announce our fiancailles.
What an astonishment for everybody!"</p>

<p>"And then," she asked&mdash;"after that?"</p>

<p>"After that, I will stay ashore for a while. They
can do without me on the <i>Soleil</i>. And at the end of a
month"&mdash;he told her the rest with a kiss; and surely
Zabette had never been so happy in her life.</p>

<p>But for the time being the affair was kept very, very
secret, so that people might not get to gossiping. Even
those frequent expeditions of Maxence to the Grande
Anse were not remarked, for he always came after
dusk: and when the fortnight was over and the <i>Soleil</i>
once more was ready for sea, the two sweethearts
exchanged keepsakes, and he left her.</p>

<p>"I will send you a letter from St. Pierre Miquelon,"
he said, to cheer her, while he wiped away her tears
with a silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Do you promise?" she asked.</p>

<p>He promised. Three weeks later the letter arrived;
and it told her that his heart was breaking for his dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
little Zabette. "Sois fidèle&mdash;be true," were the last
words. The letter had a perfume of pomade about
it, and she carried it all summer in her bodice, taking
it out many times a day to scan the loving words again.</p>

<p>In St. Esprit, when the fishing fleet begins to return
from the Banks, they keep an old man on the lookout
in the church tower; and as soon as he sights a vessel
in the offing, he rings the bell.</p>

<p>It was the fourth week in October that year before
the bell was heard; and then rapidly, two or three at a
time, the schooners came in. First the <i>Dame Blanche</i>,
which was always in the lead; then the <i>Êtoile</i>, the <i>Deux
Frères</i>, the <i>Lottie B.</i>, and the <i>Milo</i>. Every day, morning
or afternoon, the bell would ring, and poor Zabette
must find some excuse or other to be in town.
Down at the wharf there was always gathered an anxious
throng, watching for the appearance of the vessel
round the Cape. And when she was visible at last,
there would be cries of joy from some, and silence on
the part of others. Zabette was among the silent.
When she saw the happiness about her, tears would
swim unbidden in her eyes; but of course she did not
lose heart, for still there were several vessels to
arrive, and no disasters had been reported by the
earlier comers. People noticed her, standing there with
expectant mien, and they wondered what it could be
that brought her; but it was not their habit to ask questions
of the fine highstepper.</p>

<p>There was another young girl on the wharf, too,
who had the air of looking for some one&mdash;a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Suzanne Benoît, from l'Étang, three miles inshore, a
very pretty girl, with a mild, appealing look in her
brown eyes. Zabette had seen her often here and
there; but she had no acquaintance with her. At the
present moment, strangely enough, she felt herself
powerfully drawn to this Suzanne. It came to her,
somehow, that the girl had come thither on a mission
similar to her own, she was so silent, and had not the
look of those who had waited on the wharf in previous
years. And so, one afternoon, when two vessels
had rounded the Cape and were entering the harbor,
amid a great hubbub of expectancy,&mdash;and neither of
them was the <i>Soleil</i>,&mdash;Zabette surprised a look of woe
in the face of the other which she could not resist. She
went over to her, with some diffidence, and offered a
few words of sympathy.</p>

<p>"You are waiting for some one, too?" she asked
her.</p>

<p>The eyes of the other filled quickly to overflowing.
"Yes," she answered. "He has not come yet."</p>

<p>"You must not worry," said Zabette, stoutly.
"There are always delays, you know. Some are
ahead; others behind; it is so every year."</p>

<p>The girl gave her a grateful look, and squeezed her
hand. "It is a secret," she murmured.</p>

<p>Zabette smiled. "I have a secret too."</p>

<p>"Then we are waiting together," said Suzanne.
"That makes it so much easier!"</p>

<p>They walked back to the street, arm in arm, as if
they had always been bosom friends. And the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
day they were both at the wharf again. The afternoon
was bleak; but as usual they were in their best
clothes.</p>

<p>"Oh, it does not seem as if I could wait any longer,"
whispered Suzanne, confidingly. "I do hope it will
be the <i>Soleil</i> this time."</p>

<p>"The <i>Soleil</i>!" exclaimed Zabette, joyfully. "You
are waiting for the <i>Soleil</i>?"</p>

<p>And at the other's nod, she went on. "How lovely
that we are expecting the same vessel. Oh, I am sure
it will come to-day&mdash;or certainly to-morrow."</p>

<p>The two girls felt themselves very close together,
now that they had shared so much of their secret; and
it made the waiting less hard to bear.</p>

<p>"Is he handsome, your man?" asked Suzanne,
timidly.</p>

<p>"Ravishing," replied Zabette, eagerly. "And
yours?"</p>

<p>Suzanne sighed with adoration. "Beyond words,"
was her reply&mdash;and the girls exchanged another of
those pressures of the hand which mean so much where
love is concerned. "He has the most beautiful moustache
in the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," protested Zabette, smilingly. "Mine has
a more beautiful one yet, and such crisp curly hair, and
dark eyes."</p>

<p>Her companion suddenly looked at her. "Large
eyes or small?" she asked in a strange voice.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Zabette, doubtfully. "Not too large.
I would not fancy ox eyes in a man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Suzanne freed herself and stood facing her with a
flash of hatred in her mild face which Zabette could
not understand.</p>

<p>"And his name!" she demanded, harshly. "His
name, then!"</p>

<p>Zabette smiled a little proudly. "That is my secret,"
she replied. "But, Suzanne, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"It is not your secret," laughed the other, bitterly.
"It is not your secret. It is my secret."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried Zabette, with a sudden
feeling of terror at the girl's drawn face.</p>

<p>"His name is Maxence!" Suzanne's laugh was like
bones rattling in a coffin.</p>

<p>It seemed to Zabette as if a flash of lightning had
cleft her soul in two. That was the way the truth came
to her. She drew back like a viper ready to strike.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate you!" she cried, and turned on her heel,
white to the eyes with anger and shame.</p>

<p>But Suzanne would not leave her. She followed to
the other side of the wharf, and as soon as she could
speak again without attracting attention, she said,
more kindly:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for you, Zabette. It is too bad
you were so mistaken. Why, he was engaged to me
the very second day he came ashore."</p>

<p>Zabette stifled back a cry, and retorted, icily, "He
was engaged to me the first day. He followed me all
the way to the Grande Anse."</p>

<p>Suzanne's eyes glittered, this time. "He followed
me all the way to l'Étang. He is mine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Zabette brought out, through white lips, "Leave me
alone. He was mine first."</p>

<p>"He was mine last," retaliated the other, undauntedly.
"The very morning he went away, he came to see
me. Did he come to you that day? Did he? Did he?"</p>

<p>Zabette ignored her question. "He wrote me a letter
from St. Pierre Miquelon," she announced, crisply.
"So that settles it, first and last."</p>

<p>The hand of Suzanne suddenly lifted to her bosom,
as if feeling for something. "My letter was written
at St. Pierre, too."</p>

<p>For an instant they glared at each other like wild
animals fighting over prey. Neither said a word.
Neither yielded a hair. Each felt that her life's happiness
was at stake. Zabette had thought that this
chit of a girl from l'Étang was mild and timid; but
now she realized that she had met her match for courage.
And the thought came to her: "When he sees
us, let him choose."</p>

<p>She was not conscious of having uttered the words.
Perhaps her glance, swiftly directed toward the Cape,
conveyed the thought to her rival. At all events the
answer came promptly and with complete self-assurance:</p>

<p>"Yes, let Maxence choose."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the first vessel appeared at
the harbor entrance, while the bell redoubled its jubilation
in the church tower on the hill.</p>

<p>"The <i>Mercure</i>!" cried an old woman. "Thank
God!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>And a few minutes later, there was the <i>Anne-Marie</i>,
all sail set over her green hull; and then a vessel which
at first no one seemed to recognize.</p>

<p>"Which is that?" they asked. "Oh, it must be&mdash;yes,
it is the <i>Soleil</i>, from Rivière Bourgeoise. She has
several men from here aboard."</p>

<p>With eyes that seemed to be starting from her head,
Zabette watched the <i>Soleil</i> entering the harbor. She
could distinguish forms on deck. She saw handkerchiefs
waving. At last she could begin to make out
the faces a little. But she did not discover the one she
sought. Holding tight to a mooring post, unable to
think, unable to do anything but watch, it seemed to
her that hours passed before the schooner cast anchor
and a boat was put over. There were four persons in
it: the mate and the three men from St. Esprit. They
rowed rapidly to the wharf; and the three men threw
up their gunny sacks and climbed the ladder, one after
the other.</p>

<p>The mate was just about to put off again when
Zabette spoke to him. She leaned over the edge of the
wharf, reaching out a detaining hand.</p>

<p>"M'sieur!"</p>

<p>At the same instant the word was uttered by another
voice close by. She looked up and saw Suzanne, very
white, in the same attitude.</p>

<p>"What is it, mesdemoiselles?" asked the mate,
touching his vizor.</p>

<p>As if by concerted arrangement came the question
from both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Maxence?"</p>

<p>The man answered them seriously and directly, perceiving
from their manner that his reply was of great
import to these two, whatever the reason for it might be.</p>

<p>"Maxence?&mdash;But we do not know where he is.
There was a fog. He was out in a dory, alone. We
picked up the dory the next day. Perhaps"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders incredulously&mdash;"perhaps he
might have been picked up by another vessel. Who
can say?"</p>

<p>The girls gave him no answer. They reeled, and
would have fallen, save that each found support in the
other's arms. Sinking to the string piece of the
wharf, they buried their faces on each other's shoulders
and sobbed. Happy fathers and mothers and
sweethearts, gathered on the wharf, looked at them in
wonder, and left them alone, ignorant of the cause of
their grief. So a long time passed, and still they
crouched there, tight clasped, with buried heads.</p>

<p>"He was so good, so brave!" sobbed Suzanne.</p>

<p>"I loved him so much," repeated Zabette, over and
over.</p>

<p>"I shall die without him," moaned Suzanne.</p>

<p>"So shall I," responded the other. "I cannot bear
to live any longer."</p>

<p>"If only I had a picture of him, that would be some
comfort," said the poor girl from l'Étang.</p>

<p>"I have one," said Zabette, sitting up straight and
putting some orderly touches to her disarranged <i>mouchoir</i>.
"He gave it to me the very last night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Suzanne looked at her enviously, and mopped her
red eyes. "All I have," she sighed, "is a little shell
box he brought me, with the motto, <i>À ma chérie</i>. He
gave me that the very last morning of all. It is very
beautiful, but no one but me has seen it yet."</p>

<p>"You must show it to me sometime," said Zabette.
"I have a right to see it."</p>

<p>"If you will let me look at the picture," consented
the other, guardedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may look at it," said Zabette, "so long as
you do not forget that it belongs to me."</p>

<p>"To you!" retorted the other. "And have you a
better right to it than I, seeing that he would have been
my husband in a month's time? You are a bad, cruel
girl; you have no heart. It is a mercy he escaped the
traps you set for him&mdash;my poor Maxence!"</p>

<p>A thousand taunting words came to Zabette's lips,
but she controlled herself, rose to her feet with a show
of dignity, and quitted the wharf. She resolved that
she would never speak to that Benoît girl again. To
do so was only to be insulted.</p>

<p>She went back to her home on the Grande Anse and
endeavored to take up her everyday life again as
though nothing had happened. She hid her grief from
the neighbors, even from her own parents, who had
never suspected the strength of her attachment for
Maxence. By day she could keep herself busy about
the house, and the secret would only be a dull pain;
but at night, especially when the wind blew, it would
gnaw and gnaw at her heart like a hungry beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>At last she could keep it to herself no longer. She
must share her misery. But there was only one person
in the world who could understand. She declared to
herself that nothing would induce her to go to
l'Étang; and yet, as if under a spell, she made ready
for the journey.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, my Zabette?" asked her old
mother.</p>

<p>"To l'Étang," she answered. "I hear there is a
girl there who makes a special brown dye for wool."</p>

<p>"Well, the walk will do you good, ma fille. You
have been indoors too much lately. You are growing
right pale and ill-looking."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is nothing, maman. I never feel very brisk,
you know, in November. 'Tis such a dreary month."</p>

<p>She took a back road across the barrens to l'Étang.
Scarcely any one traveled it except in winter to fetch
kindling wood from the scrub fir that grew there. Consequently
Zabette was much surprised, after walking
about a mile and a half, to discover that some one was
approaching from the opposite direction&mdash;a woman,
with a red shawl across her shoulders. Gradually the
distance between them lessened; and then she saw, with
a start, that it was Suzanne Benoît. Her knees began
to tremble under her. When they met, at last, no
words would come to her lips: they only looked at each
other with questioning, hunted eyes, then embraced,
weeping, and sat down silently on a moss-hummock beside
the road. Zabette had not felt so comforted since
the disaster of October. For the first time she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
let the tears flow without any fear of detection. At
last she said, very calmly:</p>

<p>"I have brought the picture."</p>

<p>She drew it out from under her coat, and held it on
her knees, where Suzanne could see it.</p>

<p>"And here is the shell box," rejoined her companion.
"I do not know how to read, me; but there are
the words&mdash;<i>À ma chérie</i>. It's pretty&mdash;<i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Each gazed at the other's treasure.</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Suzanne, mournfully. "How handsome
he was to look at&mdash;and so true and brave!"</p>

<p>"I shall never love another," said Zabette, with sad
conviction&mdash;"never. Love is over for me."</p>

<p>"And for me," said Suzanne. "But we have our
memories."</p>

<p>"Mine," corrected Zabette. "You are forgetting."</p>

<p>"Did he ever give you a present that said <i>À ma
chérie</i>?" demanded Suzanne, pointedly.</p>

<p>The other explained blandly: "You cannot say anything,
my dear, on the back of a tintype.&mdash;But I have
my letter from St. Pierre."</p>

<p>She showed it.</p>

<p>"Even if I cannot read mine," declared the girl from
l'Étang, hotly, "I know it is fully as nice as yours.
Nicer!"</p>

<p>"Oh, can I never see you but you must insult me!"
cried Zabette. "Keep your old box and your precious
letter from St. Pierre Miquelon. What can they matter
to me?"</p>

<p>Without a word of good-by she sprang to her feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and set out for the Grande Anse. She did not see the
Benoît girl again that winter; but she could not help
thinking about her, sometimes with sympathy, sometimes
with bitter hatred. The young men came flocking
to her home, as usual, vying with one another in
attentions to her, for not only was Zabette known as
the handsomest girl in three parishes, but also as an
excellent housekeeper&mdash;"good saver, rare spender."</p>

<p>She would not encourage any of them, however.</p>

<p>"If I marry," she said to herself, "it is giving Maxence
over to that l'Étang girl. She will crow about it.
She will say, 'At last he is mine altogether. She has
surrendered.' No, I could not stand that."</p>

<p>So that winter passed, and the next summer, and
other winters and summers. Zabette did not marry;
and after a time she began hearing herself spoken of
as an old maid. The young men flocked to other
houses, not hers. At the end of twelve years both her
father and mother were dead, and she was alone in the
world, thirty, and unprovided for.</p>

<p>It was, of course, fated, that these two women whose
lives had been so strangely entangled should drift
together again, sooner or later. So long as both were
young and could claim love for themselves, jealousy
was bound to separate them; but when they found
themselves quite alone in the world, no longer beautiful,
no longer arousing thoughts of love in the breast
of another, the memory of all that was most precious
in their lives drew them together as surely as a magnet
draws two bits of metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>It was after mass, one Sunday, that Zabette sought
out her rival finally and found the courage to propose
a singular plan.</p>

<p>"You are alone, Suzanne," she said. "So am I.
We are both poor. Come and live with me."</p>

<p>"And you will give me Maxence?" asked Suzanne,
a little hardly.</p>

<p>"No. But I will give you half of him. See, why
should we quarrel any more? He is dead. Let us be
reasonable. After this he shall belong to both of us."</p>

<p>Still the <i>vieille fille</i> from l'Étang held back, though
her eyes softened.</p>

<p>"All these years," she said, with a remnant of defiance&mdash;"all
these years he has been mine. I did not
get married, me, because that would have let him
belong to you."</p>

<p>Zabette sighed wearily. "And all these years I have
been saying the same thing. And yet I could never forget
the shell box and your letter from St. Pierre Miquelon.
Come, don't you see how much easier it will be&mdash;how
much more natural&mdash;if we put our treasures
together: all we have of Maxence, and call him <i>ours</i>?"</p>

<p>Suzanne was beginning to yield, but doubtfully. "If
it would be proper," she said.</p>

<p>"Not if he were living, of course," replied the other,
with assurance. "The laws of the church forbid that.
But in the course of a lifetime a husband may have
more than one wife. I do not see why, when a husband
is dead, two wives should not have him. Do
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will come," said Suzanne, softly and gratefully.
"I am so lonely."</p>

<p>Three years later the two women moved from the
Grande Anse into the village, renting the little cottage
with the dormer windows in which they have lived ever
since. You must look far to find so devoted a pair.
They are more than sisters to each other. If their
lives have not been happy, as the world judges happiness,
they have at least been illumined by two great
and abiding loves,&mdash;which does not happen often,&mdash;that
for the dead, and that for each other.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>owns, like persons, I suppose, wake up
now and then to find themselves famous;
but I doubt if any town having this experience
could be more amazed by it, more
dazed by it, than was Three Rivers, one day last
March, when we opened our newspapers from Boston
and Montreal and lo, there was our own name staring
at us from the front page! Three Rivers is in the
Province of Quebec, on the shore of the Bay de Chaleurs;
but we receive our metropolitan papers every
day, only thirty-six hours off the presses; and this
makes us feel closely in touch with the outside world.
Until the railroad from Matapedia came through, four
years ago, mail was brought by stage, every second
day. The coming of the railroad had seemed an important
event then; but it had never put Three Rivers
on the front page of the Boston <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>The news-item in question was to the effect that the
S. S. <i>Maid of the North</i>, Captain Pettipaw of Three
Rivers, P. Q., had been torpedoed, forty miles off Fastnet,
while en route from Sydney, N. S., to Liverpool,
with a cargo of pig-iron. The captain and crew (said
the item) had been allowed to take to the boats; but
only one of the two boats had been heard from. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
one was in command of the mate, and had been rescued
by a trawler.</p>

<p>Captain Pettipaw of Three Rivers! <i>Our</i> Captain
Pettipaw! How well we knew him; and who among
us had ever thought of him as one likely to make Three
Rivers figure on the front page of the world's news!
Yet this had come to pass; and even amid the anxiety
we felt as to the fate of Captain Joe, we could but be
agreeably conscious of the distinction that had come to
our little community. All that afternoon poor Mrs.
Pettipaw's house was thronged with neighbors who
hurried over there, newspaper in hand, ready to congratulate
or to condole as might seem most called for.</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Pettipaw" or "poor Melina" was the
way we always spoke of her, partly, I suppose, because
of her nine children, and partly because&mdash;I hesitate to
say it&mdash;she was Captain Joe's wife. But now that it
seemed so very likely she might be his widow, our
hearts went out to her the more. You see Captain Joe
was, in our local phrase, "one of those Pettipaws."
Pettipaws never seemed to get anywhere or to do anything
that mattered. Pettipaws were always behindhand.
Pettipaws were always in trouble, one way or
another. It was a family characteristic.</p>

<p>Only five or six years ago Captain Joe's new
schooner, the <i>Melina P.</i>, had broken from her harbor
moorings under a sudden gale from the northwest and
driven square on the Fiddle Reef, where she foundered
before our eyes. Other vessels were anchored close by
the <i>Melina P.</i>; but not one of them broke loose. All
the Captain's savings for years and years had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
into the new schooner, not to speak of several hundreds
borrowed from his fellow-townsmen.</p>

<p>And the very next winter his house had burned to
the ground; and the seven children&mdash;there were only
seven then&mdash;had been parceled out amongst the neighbors
for six or seven months until, about midsummer,
the new house was roofed over and the windows set;
and then the family moved in, and there they lived for
several more months, "sort of camping-out fashion,"
as poor Melina cheerfully put it, while Captain Joe
was occasionally seen putting on a row of shingles or
sawing a board. At last, after the snow had begun to
fly, the neighbors came once more to the rescue. A collection
was made for the stricken family; carpenters
finished the house; a mason built the chimney and plastered
the downstairs partitions; curtains were donated
for the windows; and the Pettipaws spent the winter in
comfort.</p>

<p>The following spring Captain Joe got a position as
second officer on a coastwise ship out of Boston, and
the affairs of the family began to look up. From that
he was promoted to the captaincy of a little freighter
plying between Montreal and the Labrador; and the
next we knew, he was in command of a large collier
sailing out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. Poor Melina
appeared in a really handsome new traveling suit,
ordered from the big mail order house in Montreal;
and the young ones could all go to church the same
Sunday, and often did.</p>

<p>For the last year or two we had ceased to make frequent
inquiries after Captain Joe; he had dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
pretty completely out of our life; and the thought that
he might be holding a commission of special dangerousness
had never so much as entered our minds. But
poor Melina's calmness in the face of the news-item
surprised everyone. It was like a reproach to her
neighbors for not having acknowledged before the
worth of the man she had married. It had not
required a German torpedo to teach her that. And as
for his safety, that apparently caused her no anxiety
whatever.</p>

<p>"You couldn't kill the Captain," she repeated, with
a quiet, untroubled smile, which was as much as to say
that anything else might happen to a Pettipaw, but not
that.</p>

<p>The rest of us admired her faith without being able
to share it. Poor Melina rarely had leisure to read a
newspaper, and she did not know much about the disasters
of the war zone. And so, instinctively, everyone
began to say the eulogistic things about Captain
Joe that had never been said&mdash;though now we realized
they ought to have been said&mdash;while he was
with us.</p>

<p>"He was such a good man," said Mrs. Thibault, the
barrister's wife. "So devoted to his home. I remember
of how he would sit there on the doorstep for
hours, watching his little ones at their play. Poor
babies! Poor little babies!"</p>

<p>"Such a brave man, too; and so witty!" said John
Boutin, our tailor. "The stories he would tell, my!
my! Many a day in the shop he'd be telling stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
from dinner till dark, without once stopping for breath
as you might say. It passed the time so nice!"</p>

<p>"And devout!" added Mrs. Fougère, the postmistress.
"A Christian. He loved to listen to the church-bells.
I remember like it was yesterday his saying to
me, 'The man,' he said, 'who can hear a church-bell
without thinking of religion, is as good as lost, to my
thinking.'"</p>

<p>"Not that he went to church very often," said
Boutin.</p>

<p>"His knee troubled him," explained Mrs. Fougère.</p>

<p>Early in the evening came the cable message that
justified poor Melina's confidence. Eugénie White&mdash;the
Whites used to be Le Blancs, but since Eugénie
came back from Boston, they have taken the more up-to-date
name&mdash;Eugénie came flying up the street from
the railroad station, waving the yellow envelope and
spreading the news as she flew. The message consisted
of only one word: "Safe"; but it was dated Queenstown,
and it bore the signature we were henceforth to
be so proud of: Joseph Pettipaw.</p>

<p>Two days later the <i>Herald</i> contained a notice of the
rescue by a Norwegian freighter of the Captain of the
<i>Maid of the North</i>; but we had to wait ten days for
the full story, which occupied two columns in one of
the Queenstown journals and almost as much in the
Dublin <i>Post</i>, with a very lifelike photograph of Captain
Joe. It was a wonderful story, as you may very
likely remember, for the American papers gave it
plenty of attention a little later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been a calm, warm day, but with an immense
sea running. Before entering the war zone Captain
Joe had made due preparation for emergencies. The
ship's boats were ready to be swung, and in each was
a barrel of water and a supply of biscuit and other
rations. The submarine was not sighted until it was
too late to think of escaping; the engines were reversed;
and when the German commander called out through
his megaphone that ten minutes would be allowed for
the escape of the crew, all hands hurried to the lee side
and began piling into the boats. The mate's was lowered
away first and cleared safely.</p>

<p>The Captain was about to give the order for the
lowering of his own boat, when the only woman in the
party cried out that her husband was being left behind.
It was the cook, who was indulging in an untimely nap,
his noonday labors in the galley being over. In her
first excitement Martha Figman had failed to notice
his absence, but had made for the boat as fast as she
could, carrying her three-year-old child.</p>

<p>"Be quick!" called out the commander of the submarine.
"Your time is up!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain, Captain, don't leave him," implored
the desperate woman. "He's all I have!"</p>

<p>Then Captain Joe did the thing that will go down
in history. He seized the little girl and held her aloft
in his arms and called out to the Germans:</p>

<p>"In the name of this little child, grant me three
more minutes."</p>

<p>"Two!" replied the commander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Joe leaped to the deck and rushed aft, burst
open the cook's cabin, and hauled Danny Figman, quite
sound asleep, out of his berth. The poor rascal was
only partly dressed, but there was no time to make him
presentable. A blanket and a sou'wester had to suffice.
Still bewildered, he was dragged on deck and ordered
to run for his life.</p>

<p>A few seconds later the boat lowered away with its
full quota of passengers; the men took the oars,
cleared a hundred yards safely; and then there was a
snort, a white furrow through the waves, an explosion;
the <i>Maid of the North</i> listed, settled, and disappeared.
The submarine steamed quickly out of sight; and the
two boats were all that was left as witness of what had
happened.</p>

<p>On account of the terrible seas that were running,
the boats soon became separated; and for sixty-two
hours Captain Joe bent his every energy to keeping his
boat afloat, for she was in momentary danger of being
swamped, until on the third morning the Norwegian
was sighted, came to the rescue, and carried the
exhausted occupants into Queenstown.</p>

<p>Three Rivers, you may depend, had this story by
heart, and backward and forward, long before Captain
Joe returned to us; for not only did it appear in
those Irish journals, but also on the occasion of the
Captain's arrival in New York in several metropolitan
papers, written up with great detail, and with a picture
of little Tina Figman in the Captain's arms.</p>

<p>"This is the Captain," ran the print under the picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
"who risked his life that a baby might not be
fatherless."</p>

<p>You can imagine how anxious we were by this time
in Three Rivers to welcome that Captain home again;
not one of us but wanted to make ample amends for
the injustice we had done him in the past. But we had
to wait several weeks, for even after the owners had
brought Captain Joe and his crew back to New York
on the St. Louis, still he had to go to Montreal for a
ten days' stay, to depose his evidence officially and to
wind up the affairs of the torpedoed ship. But at last
he was positively returning to us; and extensive preparations
were undertaken for his reception.</p>

<p>As he was coming by the St. Lawrence steamer,
<i>Lady of Gaspé</i>, the principal decorations were massed
in the vicinity of the government wharf. If I tell you
that well nigh three hundred dollars had been collected
for this purpose from the good people of Three
Rivers, you can form some idea of the magnitude of
the effort. A double row of saplings had been set up
along the wharf and led thence to the Palace of Justice;
and the full distance, an eighth of a mile, was
hung with red and tricolor bunting. Then there were
three triumphal arches, one at the head of the wharf,
one at the turn into the street, and one in front of the
post-office. These arches were very cleverly built, with
little turrets at the corners, the timber-work completely
covered with spruce-branches; and each arch displayed
a motto. Mrs. Fougère and Eugénie White had devised
the mottoes, little John Boutin had traced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
letters on cotton, and Mrs. Boutin had painted them.
The first read: "Honor to Our Hero." The second
was in French, for the reason that half our population
still use that language by preference, and it read:
"Honneur à notre Héro"; and the third arch bore the
one word, ornately inscribed: "Welcome."</p>

<p>All the houses along the way were decorated with
geraniums and flags; and as the grass was already very
green (it was June) and the willows and silver-oaks
beginning to leave out, it may fairly be said that Three
Rivers was a beauty spot.</p>

<p>Seeing that no one can tell beforehand when a
steamer is going to arrive, the whole town was in its
best clothes and ready at an early hour of the morning.
The neighbors trooped in at poor Melina's, offering
their services in case any of the children still needed
combing, curling, or buttoning; and all through the
forenoon the young people were climbing to the top of
St. Anne's hill to see if there was any sign of the <i>Lady
of Gaspé</i>; but it was not till three in the afternoon that
the church-bell, madly ringing, announced that the
long-expected moment was about to arrive.</p>

<p>I wish I could quote for you in full the account of
that day's doings which appeared in our local sheet,
the Bonaventure <i>Record</i>, for it was beautifully written
and described every feature as it deserved, reproducing
<i>verbatim</i> the Mayor's address of welcome, Father
Quinnan's speech in the Palace, and the Resolutions
drawn up by ten representative citizens and presented
to Captain Pettipaw on a handsomely illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
scroll, which you may see to-day hanging in the place
of honor in his parlor.</p>

<p>But let my readers imagine for themselves the
arrival of the steamer, the cheer upon cheer as Captain
Joe came gravely down the gang-plank; the affecting
meeting between him and poor Melina and the nine
little Pettipaws, the littlest of whom he had never seen,
and several of whom had grown so in these last four
years that he had the names wrong, which caused
happy laughter and happy tears on all sides. Then the
procession to the Palace! There was an orchestra of
four pieces from Cape Cove; and a troop of little
girls, in white, scattered tissue-paper flowers along the
line of march.</p>

<p>The Mayor began his speech by saying that an
honor had come to our little town which would be
rehearsed from father to son for generations. Father
Quinnan took for his theme the three words: "Father,
Husband, Hero"; and he showed us how each of those
words, in its highest and best sense, necessarily comprised
the other two. And the exercises closed with a
very enjoyable piano duet which you doubtless know:
"Wandering Dreams," by some foreign composer.</p>

<p>People watched Captain Joe very closely. It would
have been only natural if, returning to us in this way,
he should have remembered a time, not so long before,
when the attitude of his fellow-citizens had been extremely
cool. But if he remembered it, he gave no
sign; and he smiled at everyone in a grave, thoughtful
manner that made one's heart beat high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has aged," whispered Mrs. Fougère. "But
his face is noble. It reminds me of Napoleon,
somehow."</p>

<p>"To me he looks more like that American we see so
often in the papers&mdash;Bryan. So much dignity!" This
from Mrs. Boutin.</p>

<p>We appreciated the Captain's freedom from condescension
the more when we heard from his own lips,
that same evening, a recital of the honors that had
been showered upon him during the past weeks. The
Mayor of Queenstown had had him to dinner; Lady
Derntwood, known as the most beautiful woman in
Ireland, had entertained him for three days at Derntwood
Park, and sent an Indian shawl as a present to
his wife. On the <i>St. Louis</i> he had sat at the Captain's
right hand; in New York he had been interviewed and
royally fêted by the newspaper-men; and at Montreal
the owners had presented him with a gold watch and a
purse of $250. Also, they had offered him another
ship immediately.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going again!" we exclaimed; and the
words were repeated from one to another in admiration&mdash;"He's
going again!" But Captain Joe smiled
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I told them I didn't mind being torpedoed," he
said ('Oh, no! Certainly not! Mind being torpedoed;
you! Captain Joe!') "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, Captain?"</p>

<p>"But I said as I couldn't bear for to see a little child
exposed again in an open boat for sixty-four hours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Captain, wouldn't they give you a ship without
a child?"</p>

<p>"They <i>said</i> they would," he replied, doubtfully,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Then what will you be doing next?" we asked,
mentally reviewing the various fields in which he might
add laurels to laurels.</p>

<p>He meditated a little while and then replied:
"Home'll suit me pretty good for a spell."</p>

<p>Well, that could be understood, certainly. Indeed,
it was to his credit. We remembered Father Quinnan's
speech. The husband, the father, had their claim.
A little stay at home, in the bosom of loved ones, yes,
to be sure, it seemed fitting and right, after the perils
of the sea.</p>

<p>And yet, why was it, as we took down the one-eighth-mile
of bunting that night, there was a faint but perceptible
dampening of our enthusiasm. Perhaps it was
the reaction from the strain and excitement of the day,
for it had been, there was no denying it, a day of days
for Three Rivers; a day, which, as Father Quinnan
had said, would be writ in letters of gold in Memory's
fair album. This day was ended now, and night came
down upon a very proud and very tired little
community.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If this were a fancy story instead of a record of
things that came to pass last year on the Gaspé Coast,
my pen should stop here; but as it is, I feel under a
plain obligation to pursue the narrative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>I've no doubt that many other towns in the history
of the world have faced precisely the same problem
that Three Rivers faced in the months following:
namely, what to do with a hero when you have one.
Oh, if you could only set them up on a pedestal in
front of the Town Hall or the post-office and <i>keep</i>
them there! A statue is so practicable. Once in so
often, say on anniversaries, you can freshen it up, hang
it with garlands and bunting, and polish the inscription;
and then the school-children can come, and somebody
can explain to them about the statue, and why we
should venerate it, and what were the splendid qualities
of the hero which we are to try to imitate in our
own lives. I hope that all cities with statues realize
their happy condition.</p>

<p>For two or three weeks after the Great Day Three
Rivers still kept its air of festivity. The triumphal
arches could be appreciated even from the train, and
many travelers, we heard, passing through, leaned out
of the windows and asked questions of the station
agent.</p>

<p>Wherever Captain Joe went, there followed a little
knot of children, listening open-mouthed for any
word that might fall from his lips; and you could
hear them explaining to one another how it was that a
man could be torpedoed and escape undamaged. At
first no one of lesser importance than the Mayor or
the Bank Manager presumed to walk with him on the
street; and he was usually to be seen proceeding in
solitary dignity to or from the post-office, head a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
bowed, one hand in the opening of his coat, his step
slow and thoughtful, while the children pattered along
behind.</p>

<p>But the barrier between the Captain and his fellow-townsmen
was entirely of their own creation, it transpired,
for he was naturally a sociable man, and now
more than ever he craved society, being sure of a deferential
hearing. Once established again in Boutin's
tailor-shop and pool-parlor, he seemed disposed never
to budge from it; and as often as you might pass, day
or night, you could hear him holding forth to whatever
company happened to be present. It was impossible
not to gather many scraps of his discourse, for
his voice was as loud as an orator's.</p>

<p>"And Lady Derntwood&mdash;no, it was Lady Genevieve,
Lady Derntwood's dairter by her first husband
and fully as beautiful as her mother, she said to me,
'Captain,' she said, 'when I read that about the little
girl&mdash;For the sake of this little child, grant me three
minutes!&mdash;the tears filled my eyes, and I said to my
maid, who had brought me my <i>Times</i> on the breakfast
tray, "Lucienne," I said, "that is a man I should be
proud to know!"'&mdash;and that's a fact sir, as true as
I'm settin' here, for Lucienne herself told me the same
thing. A little beauty, that Lucienne: black hair;
medium height. We used to talk French together."</p>

<p>Or another time you would hear: "And they said to
me, 'Captain,' they says, 'and are you satisfied with
the gold watch and chain and with the little purse we
have made up for you here, not pretending, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
for one minute,' they says, 'that 'tis any measure of
the services you have rendered to us or to your country.
We ask you,' they says, 'are you satisfied?' And
I said, 'I am,' and the fact is, I was, for the watch I'd
lost was an Ingersoll, and my clothes put together
wouldn't have brought a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>So the weeks went by; and the triumphal arches, on
which the mottoes had run a good deal, were taken
down and broken up for kindling; and still Captain Joe
sat and talked all day long and all night long, too, if
only anybody would listen to him. But listeners were
growing scarce. His story had been heard too often;
and any child in town was able to correct him when he
slipped up, which often happened. The two hundred
and fifty dollars was spent long since, and now the
local merchants were forced to insist once more on
strictly cash purchases, and many a day the Pettipaw
family must have "done meagre," as the French say.
Unless all signs failed, they would be soon living again
at the charge of the community. Close your eyes if
you like, sooner or later certain grim truths will be
borne home to you. A leopard cannot change his
spots, nor a Pettipaw his skin. Before our very eyes
the honor and glory of Three Rivers, the thing that
was to be passed from generation to generation, was
vanishing: worse than that, we were becoming ridiculous
in our own eyes, which is harder to bear, even,
than being ridiculous in the eyes of others.</p>

<p>There was one remedy and only one. It was plain
to anybody who considered the situation thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Captain Joe must be got away. So long as your hero
is alive, he can only be viewed advantageously at a distance.
At all events, if he is a Pettipaw.</p>

<p>It was proposed that we should elect him our local
member to the provincial Parliament. It might be
managed. We suggested it to him, dwelling upon the
opportunities it would afford for the exercise of his
special talents which, we said, were being thrown away
in a little town like Three Rivers. He conceded that
we spoke the truth; "but," he said, after a moment of
thoughtful silence, "I am a sailor born and bred, and
my health would never stand the confinement. Never!"</p>

<p>Next it was found that we could secure for him the
position of purser on the S. S. <i>Lady of the Gaspé</i>. But
this offer he refused even more emphatically.</p>

<p>"Purser!&mdash;Me!" There was evidently nothing
more to be said.</p>

<p>Writing to Montreal, Father Quinnan learned that
if he so wished Captain Pettipaw might have again the
command of the little freighter that ran to the Labrador;
and the proposition was laid before him with sanguine
expectations. Again he declined.</p>

<p>"The Labrador! Thank you! They wouldn't even
know who I was!"</p>

<p>"You could tell them, Captain."</p>

<p>"What good would that do?"</p>

<p>No answer being forthcoming to this demand, still
another scheme had to be sought. It was the Mayor
who finally saved the day for Three Rivers. He instigated
a Patriotic Fund, to which every man, woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and child contributed what he could, and with the proceeds
a three-masted schooner of two hundred tons
burden was acquired (she had been knocked down for
a song at a sheriff's sale at Campbellton); she was
handsomely refitted, rechristened, and presented, late
in October, to Captain Joe, as a tribute of esteem from
his native town.</p>

<p>It is not for me to say just how grateful the Captain
was, at heart; but he accepted the gift with becoming
dignity; and before the winter ice closed the Gulf (so
expeditiously had our plans been carried out) the
<i>Gloria</i> was ready to sail with a cargo of dry fish for
the Barbadoes.</p>

<p>The evening previous to her departure there was a
big farewell meeting in the Palace of Justice, with
speeches by the Mayor and Father Quinnan, a piano
duet, and an original poem by Eugénie White,
beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sail forth, sail far,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O Captain bold!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was remarkable to see how all the enthusiasm and
fervor of an earlier celebration in that same hall
sprang to life again; yes, and with a solemnity added,
for this time our hero was going from us. He sat
there on the platform by the Mayor, handsome,
square-shouldered, his head a little bowed, a thoughtful
smile on his lips under the grizzled moustache: he
was every inch the noble figure that had stood unflinching
before the gates of death; and we realized as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
never before what a debt of gratitude we owed him.
At last our hero was our hero again.</p>

<p>There is but little more to tell. The next morning,
bright and early, everybody was at the wharf to watch
the <i>Gloria</i> hoist her sails, weigh anchor, and tack out
into the bay. There were tears in many, many eyes
besides those of poor Mrs. Pettipaw. The sea had a
dark look, off there, and one thought of the dangers
that awaited any man who sailed out on it at this time
of the year.</p>

<p>"Heaven send him good passage!" said Mrs. Thibault,
wiping her eyes vigorously.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, and bring him safe home again, the brave
man!" added Mrs. Boutin, earnestly; and all those
who heard her breathed a sincere amen to that prayer.</p>

<p>It was sincere. We had wanted Captain Joe to go
away; we had actually forced him to go away; yet no
sooner was he gone than we prayed he might be
brought safe home again. Yes, for when all is said
and done, a town that has a hero must love him and
cherish him and wish him well. Because we have ours,
Three Rivers will always be a better place to live in
and to bring up children in: a more inspiring place.</p>

<p>Only, perhaps, if Mrs. Boutin had spoken less impulsively,
she would have added one or two qualifying
clauses to her petition. For instance, she might have
added: "Only not too soon, and not for too long at
once!" But for my part, I believe that will be understood
by the good angel who puts these matters on
record, up there.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hey called her Sabine Bob&mdash;"S'been Bob"&mdash;because
her real name was Sabine Anne
Boudrot; and being a Boudrot in Petit Espoir
is like being a Smith or a Brown in our
part of the world, only ten times more so, for in that
little fishing-port of Cape Breton, down in the Maritime
Provinces, practically everybody belongs to the
abounding tribe. Boudrot, therefore, having ceased to
possess more than a modicum of specificity (to borrow
a term from the logicians), the custom has arisen
of tagging the various generations and households of
Boudrots with the familiar name of the father that
begat them.</p>

<p>And thus Sabine Anne Boudrot, "old girl" of fifty,
was known only as Sabine Bob, and Mary Boudrot,
her friend, to whom she was dictating a love-letter on
a certain August evening, was known only as Mary
Willee&mdash;with the accent so strongly on the final syllable
that it sounded like Marywil-Lee. Sabine Bob
was in service; always had been. Mary kept house
for an invalid father. But there was no social distinction
between the two.</p>

<p>Mary Willee bent close over the sheet of ruled note-paper
and laboriously traced out the words, dipping
her pen every few seconds with professional punctiliousness
and screwing up her homely face into all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of homely expressions: tongue now tight-bitten between
her teeth, now working restlessly in one cheek,
now hard pressed against bulging lips. There was
agony for both of them in this business of producing a
love-letter: agony for Mary Willee because she had
never fully mastered the art of writing, and the shaping
just-so of the letters and above all the spelling
brought out beads of sweat on her forehead; agony
for Sabine Bob because her heart was so burstingly
full and words were so powerless to ease that bursting.</p>

<p>Besides, how could she be sure, really, positively
<i>sure</i>, that Mary Willee was recording there on that
paper the very words, just those very words and none
others, which she was confiding to her! Writing was
a tricky affair. Tricky, like the English language
which Sabine Bob was using, against her will, for the
reason that Mary Willee had never learned to write
French. French was natural. In French one could
say what one thought: it felt homelike. In English
one had to be stiff.</p>

<p>"Read me what I have said so far," directed Sabine
Bob, and she held to the seat of her chair with her
bony hands and listened.</p>

<p>Mary Willee began, compliantly. "'My dearling
Thomas'"&mdash;</p>

<p>Sabine Bob interrupted. "The number of the day
comes first. Always! I brought you the calendar with
the day marked on it."</p>

<p>"I wrote it here," said Mary Willee. "You need
not be so anxious. I have done letters before this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but everything is so important!" ejaculated
Sabine, with tragedy in her voice. "Now begin again."</p>

<p>"'My dearling Thomas. It is bad times here. So
much fogg all ways. i was houghing potatoes since 2
days and they looks fine and i am nitting yous some
socks for when yous come back. i hope you is getting
lots of them poggiz.'"</p>

<p>Mary Willee hesitated. "I ain't just sure how to
spell that word," she confessed.</p>

<p>"Pogeys?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You ought to be. What for did they send you to
the convent all those four years?"</p>

<p>"It was only three. And the nuns never taught us
no such things as about pogey-fishing. But no matter.
Thomas Ned will know what you mean, because that's
what he's gone fishing after."</p>

<p>And she continued: "'I miss yous awful some days.
when you comes back in octobre we's git married
sure.'"</p>

<p>She looked up. "That's all you told me so far."</p>

<p>Sabine's face was drawn into furrows of intense
thought. "How many more lines is there to fill?"</p>

<p>"Seven."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell him I was looking at the little
house what his auntie Sophie John left him and thinking
how nice it would be when there was some front
steps and the shimney was fix' and there were curtains
to the windows in front and some geraniums and I t'ink
I will raise some hens because they are such good com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>pany
running in and out all day when he will be away
pogey-fishing but perhaps when we're married he won't
have to go off any more because his healt' is put to
danger by it and how would it do, say, if he got a little
horse and truck with the hundred and fifty dollars I
got saved up and did work by the day for people
ashore and then"&mdash;she paused for breath.</p>

<p>"Is that too much to write?" she remarked with
sudden anxiety.</p>

<p>"It is," replied Mary Willee, firmly. "You can
say two things, and then good-by."</p>

<p>Two things! Sabine Bob stared at the little yellow
circle of light on the smoky ceiling over the lamp; then
out of the window into the darkness. Two things
more; and there were so many thousand things to say!
Her mind was a blank.</p>

<p>"I am waiting," Mary reminded her, poising her
pen pitilessly.</p>

<p>"Tell him," gasped out Sabine, "tell him&mdash;I t'ink
I raise some hens."</p>

<p>Letter by letter the pregnant sentence was inscribed,
while Sabine stared at the pen with paralyzed attention,
as if her doom were being written in the Book
of Judgment; and now the time had come for the second
thing! Tears of helplessness stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ask him," she blurted out, "would the hundred
and fifty dollars what I got buy a nice little horse and
truck."</p>

<p>Mary Willee paused. She seemed embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Write it," commanded the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Willee looked almost frightened. "Must you
say that about the money?" she asked, weakly.</p>

<p>"Write the words I told you," insisted Sabine.
"This is my letter, not yours."</p>

<p>Reluctantly the younger woman set down the sentence;
then added the requisite and necessary "Good-by,
from Sabine."</p>

<p>"Is there room for a few kisses?" asked the fiancée.</p>

<p>"One row."</p>

<p>Sabine seized the pen greedily and holding it between
clenched fingers added a line of significant little
lop-sided symbols. Then while her secretary prepared
the letter for mailing, she wiped her forehead with a
large blue handkerchief which she refolded and returned
to the skirt-pocket that contained her rosary
and her purse. She put on her little old yellow-black
hat again and made ready to go.</p>

<p>"Now to the post-office," she said. "How glad
Thomas Ned will be when he gets it!"</p>

<p>"I am sure he will," said Mary; and if there was
any doubt in her tone, it was not perceived by her
friend, who suddenly flung her arms about her in a
gush of happy emotion.</p>

<p>"Dieu, que c'est beau, l'amour!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The sentiment was not a new one in the world; but
it was still a new one, and very wonderful, to Sabine
Bob: Sabine Bob who had never been pretty, even in
youthful days, who had never had any nice clothes
or gone to parties, but had just scrubbed and washed
and swept, saved what she could, gone to church on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Sundays, bought a new pair of shoes every other year.</p>

<p>Not that she had ever thought of pitying herself.
She was too practical for that; and besides, there had
always been plenty to be happy about. The music in
church, for instance, which thrilled and dissolved and
comforted her; and the pictures there, which she loved
to gaze at, especially the one of Our Lady above the
altar.</p>

<p>And then there were children! No one need be very
unhappy, it seemed to Sabine Bob, in a world where
there were children. She never went out without first
putting a few little hard, colored candies in her pocket
to dispense along the street, over gates and on front
steps. The tinier the children were the more she loved
them. Every spring in Petit Espoir there was a fresh
crop of the very tiniest of all; and towards these&mdash;little
pink bundles of softness and helplessness&mdash;she felt
something of the adoration which those old Wise Men
felt who had followed the star. If she had had spices
and frankincense, Sabine Bob would have offered it, on
her knees. But in lieu of that, she brought little knitted
sacques and blankets and hoods.</p>

<p>Such had been Sabine Bob's past; and that a day
was to come in her life when a handsome young man
should say sweet, loving things to her, present her with
perfumery, bottle on bottle, ask her to be his wife,
bless you, she would have been the first to scout the
ridiculous idea&mdash;till six months ago! Thomas Ned
was a small man, about forty, squarely built, with pink
cheeks, long lashes, luxuriant moustache; a pretty man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
a man who cut quite a figure amongst the girls and
(many declared) could have had his pick of them.
Why, why, had he chosen Sabine Bob? When she
considered the question thoughtfully, she found
answers enough, for she was not a girl who underestimated
her own worth.</p>

<p>"Thomas is sensible," she explained to Mary Willee.
"He knows better than to take up with one of
those weak, sickly young things that have nothing but
a pretty face and stylish clothes to recommend them.
I can work; I can save; I can make his life easy. He
knows he will be well looked out for."</p>

<p>If Mary Willee could have revised this explanation,
she refrained from doing so. It would have taken
courage to do so at that moment, for Sabine Bob was
so happy! It was almost comical for any one to be so
happy as that! Sabine realized it and laughed at herself
and was happier still. Morning, noon, and night,
during those first mad, marvelous days after she had
promised to become Madame Thomas Ned, she was
singing a bit of gay nonsense she had known from
childhood:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vive la Canadienne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Vole, vole, vole, mon coeur!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Fly, fly, oh fly, my heart," trolled Sabine Bob; and
every evening, until the time came when he must depart
for the pogey-fishing, in May, he had come and
sat with her in the kitchen; he would smoke; she would
knit away at a pair of mittens for him (oh, such small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
hands as that Thomas had!), and about ten o'clock
she would fetch a glass of blueberry wine and some
currant cookies. How nice it was to be doing such
things for some one&mdash;of one's own!</p>

<p>She hovered over him like a ministering spirit,
beaming and tender. This was what she had starved
for all her life without knowing it: to serve some one
of her own! Not for wages now; for love! She flung
herself on the altar of Thomas and burned there with
a clear ecstatic flame.</p>

<p>And now that he had been away four months, pogey-fishing,
she would sometimes console herself by getting
out the five picture-postcards he had sent her and muse
upon the scenes of affection depicted there and pick out,
word by word, the brief messages he had written. With
Mary Willee's assistance she had memorized them;
and they were words of sempiternal devotion; and
there were little round love-knows-what's in plenty;
and on one card he called her his little wife; and that
was the one she prized the most. Wife! Sabine Bob!</p>

<p>That no card arrived in answer to her August letter
did not surprise her, for the pogeymen often did not
put into port for weeks at a time; and anyhow the day
was not far away, now, when the season would be over
and those who had gone up from Petit Espoir would
come down again.</p>

<p>So the weeks slipped by. October came. The
pogey-fishermen returned.</p>

<p>She waited for Thomas Ned in the kitchen that first
evening, palpitating with expectancy; and he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
come. During the sleepless night that followed she
conjured up excuses for him. He had had one of his
attacks of rheumatism. His mother had been ill and
had required his presence at home. The next evening
he would come, oh certainly, and explain everything.
Attired in her best, she sat and waited a second evening;
then a third. There was no sign of him.</p>

<p>From Mary Willie she learned that Thomas had
arrived with the others; that he appeared in perfect
health, never handsomer; also that his mother was well.</p>

<p>"Oh, it cannot be that anything has happened,"
cried Sabine, with choking tears. "Surely it will all be
explained soon!" But there was a tightening about
her heart, a black premonition of ill to come.</p>

<p>She continued to wait. She was on the watch for
him day and night. At least he would pass on the
street, and she could waylay him! Every time she
heard footsteps or voices she flew to the kitchen door.
When her work was done, she would hurry out to the
barn, where there was a little window commanding a
good view of the harbor-front; and there she would
sit, muffled in a shawl, for hours, hunger gnawing at
her heart, her eyes dry and staring, until her teeth
began to chatter with cold and nervousness.</p>

<p>He never passed. Some one met him taking the
back road into the village. He was purposely avoiding
her.</p>

<p>When Sabine Bob realized that she was deserted by
the man she loved, thrown aside without a word, she
suffered unspeakably; but her native good sense saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
her from making any exhibition of her grief. She knew
better than to make a fool of herself. If there was
one thing she dreaded worse than death it was being
laughed at. She was a self-respecting girl; she had
her pride. And no one witnessed the spasms, the
cyclones, which sometimes seized her in the seclusion
of her little attic bedroom. These were not the picturesque,
grandiose sufferings of high tragedy; there was
small resemblance between Sabine Bob and Carthaginian
Dido; Sabine's agonies were stark and cruel and
ugly, unsoftened by poetry. But she kept them to
herself.</p>

<p>She did her work as before. But she did not sing;
and perhaps she nicked more dishes than usual, for her
hands trembled a good deal. But she kept her lips
tight shut. And she never went out on the street if
she could help it.</p>

<p>So a month passed. Two months. And then one
evening Mary Willee came running in breathless with
news for her: news that made her skin prickle and her
blood, after one dizzy, faint moment, drum hotly in
her temples.</p>

<p>Thomas Ned was paying attentions to Tina Lejeune,
that blonde young girl from the Ponds. He had
taken her to a dance. He had bought a scarf for her
and a bottle of perfumery. He had taken her to drive.
They had been seen walking together several times in
the dark on the upper street.</p>

<p>"Does he say he is going to marry her?" asked
Sabine Bob, with dry lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not know that. <i>She</i> says so. She says they
are to be married soon."</p>

<p>"Does she know about&mdash;about me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she says&mdash;" Mary Willee stopped short
in embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Says what! Tell me! Tell me at once!" commanded
Sabine, fiercely. "What does she say!"</p>

<p>"She says Thomas thought you had a lot of money.
He was deceived, he said."</p>

<p>Sabine broke out in a passion of indignation. "I
never deceived him: never, never! I never once said
anything about money. He never asked me anything.
It's a lie. I tell you, it's a lie!"</p>

<p>Mary quailed visibly, unable to disguise a tell-tale
look of guilt.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Mary Willee!" cried
Sabine. "You are hiding something. You know something
you have not told me!"</p>

<p>Mary replied, in a very frightened voice: "Once he
asked me if you had any money. I did not think he
was really in earnest, so I told him you had saved a
thousand dollars. Oh, I didn't mean any harm. I only
said it to be agreeable. And later I was afraid to tell
the truth, for it was only two or three days later he
asked you to marry him, and you were so happy."</p>

<p>Mary Willee hid her face in her hands and waited
for the storm to break upon her; but it did not break.
The room was very quiet. At last she heard Sabine
moving about, and she looked up again. Sabine was
putting on her hat and coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sabine! Sabine!" she gasped. "What are you
doing!"</p>

<p>Sabine Bob turned quietly and stood for a moment
gazing at her without a word. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Mary Willee, you are a bad girl and I can never
forgive you; but if Tina Lejeune thinks she is going to
marry Thomas Ned, she will find out that she is mistaken.
That is a thing that will not happen."</p>

<p>Mary recoiled, terrified, at the pitiless, menacing
smile on the other woman's face; but before she could
say anything Sabine Bob had stalked out of the house
into the darkness.</p>

<p>She climbed the hill to the back road, stumbling
often, blinded more by her own fierce emotions than by
the winter night; she fought her way westward against
the bitter wind that was rising; then turned off by the
Old French Road, as it was called, toward the Ponds.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night; stars, but no moon. She
saw a shadow approaching in the darkness from the
opposite direction: it was a man, short and squarely-built.
With a sickening weakness she sank down
against the wattle fence at the side of the road. He
passed her, so close that she could have reached out
and touched him. But he had not seen. She got up
and hurried on.</p>

<p>By and by she saw ahead of her the little black bulk
of a house from the tiny window of which issued a yellow
glow. The house stood directly on the road. She
went quietly to the window and looked in. A young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
girl was sitting by a bare table, her head supported by
the palms of her hands. Sabine knew the weak white
face and hated it. She made her way to the door and
knocked. There was a smothered, startled exclamation;
then the rustle of some one moving.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" inquired a timid voice.</p>

<p>"Let me in and I will tell you," responded the
woman outside, in a voice the more menacing because
of its control.</p>

<p>"My mother is not at home to-night. She is over
at the widow Babinot's. If you go over there you will
find her."</p>

<p>"It is you I wish to see. Open the door!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Sabine turned the knob and
entered. At the sight of her the blonde girl gave a
cry of dismay and retreated behind the table,
trembling.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"We have an account to settle together, you and
me," said Sabine, with something like a laugh.</p>

<p>"Account?" said the other, bracing herself, but
scarcely able to articulate. "What account? I have
not done you any harm. Before God I have not done
you any harm."</p>

<p>Sabine laughed mockingly. "So you think there is
no harm in taking away from me the man I was going
to marry?"</p>

<p>"I did not take him away," said Tina, faintly.</p>

<p>"You did! You did take him away!" cried Sabine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
fiercely. "He was mine; it was last March he promised
to marry me; any one can tell you that. I have
witnesses. I have letters. Everything I tell you can
be proved. He belongs to me just as much as if we
had been before a priest already; and if you think you
can take him away from me, you will find out you are
wrong!"</p>

<p>For a few seconds the paralyzed girl before her
could not utter a word; then she stammered out:</p>

<p>"He told me you had deceived him about money."</p>

<p>Sabine gave an inarticulate cry of rage, like a wild
beast at bay. "It's a lie! A lie! I never deceived
him. It's he who deceived me; but let me tell you this:
when a woman like me promises to marry a man, she
keeps her word. Do you understand? She keeps her
word! I am going to marry Thomas Ned. He cannot
escape me. I will go to the priest. I will go to the
lawyer. There are plenty of ways."</p>

<p>The blonde girl sank trembling into a chair.</p>

<p>"He cannot marry you," she gasped. "He cannot.
He cannot."</p>

<p>"No?" cried Sabine, with ringing mockery. "And
why not?"</p>

<p>Tina's lips moved inaudibly. She moistened them
with her tongue and made a second attempt.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;" she breathed.</p>

<p>"Yes? Yes?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;he must marry me." She buried her
head in her hands and sobbed.</p>

<p>Sabine Bob strode to the cringing girl, seized her by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the shoulders, forcing her up roughly against the back
of the chair, and broke out with a ruthless laugh:</p>

<p>"Must! Must! You don't say so! And why, tell
me, must he marry you?"</p>

<p>The white girl raised her eyes for one instant to the
other's face; and there was a look in them of mute
pleading and confession, a look that was like a death-cry
for pity. The look shot through Sabine's turgid
consciousness like a white-hot dagger. She staggered
back as if mortally stricken, supporting herself against
a tall cupboard, staring at the girl, whose head had
now sunk to the table again and whose body was shaking
with spasmodic sobs. It was one of the moments
when destinies are written.</p>

<p>At such moments we act from something deeper,
more elemental, than will. The best or the worst in
us leaps out&mdash;or perhaps neither one nor the other
but merely that thing in us that is most essentially
ourselves.</p>

<p>Sabine stared at the poor girl whose terrifying, wonderful
secret had just been revealed to her, and she felt
through all her being a sense of shattering and disintegration;
and suddenly she was there, beside Tina, on
the arm of her chair; and she brought the girl's head
over against her bosom and held her very tight in her
eager old arms, patting her shoulders and stroking her
soft hair, while the tears rained down her cheeks and
she murmured, soothingly:</p>

<p>"Pauvre petite!" and again and again, "Pauvre
petite! Ma pauvre petite!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Tina abandoned herself utterly to the other's impassioned
tenderness; and for a long time the two sat
there, tightly clasped, silent, understanding.</p>

<p>Sabine Bob had no word of blame for the unhappy
girl. Vaguely she knew that she ought to blame her;
very vaguely she remembered that girls like this were
bad girls; but that did not seem to make any difference.
Instead of indignation she felt something very like
humility and reverence.</p>

<p>"Yes, he must marry you," she said at last, very
simply and gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, if he only would!" sobbed Tina.</p>

<p>"What!" cried Sabine, in amazement.</p>

<p>"He says such cruel things to me," confessed the
girl. "He knows, oh, he does know I never loved any
man but himself; never, never any other man, nor ever
will!"</p>

<p>Sabine's eyes opened upon new vistas of man's perfidiousness.
And yet, in spite of everything, how one
could love them! She felt an immense compassion
toward this poor girl who had loved not wisely but so
all-givingly.</p>

<p>"I will go to him," she said, resolutely. "I will tell
him he must marry you; and I will say that if he does
not, I will tell every person in Petit Espoir what a
wicked thing he has done."</p>

<p>Tina leaped to her feet in terror. "Oh, no, no!"
she pleaded. "No one must know."</p>

<p>Sabine understood. Not the present only, but the
future must be thought of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if he was forced like that to marry me, he
would hate me," pursued the girl, who saw things with
the pitiless clear foresight that desperation gives. "He
must marry me from his own choice. Oh, if I could
only make him choose; but to-night he said NO! and
went away, very angry. I'm afraid he will never come
back again."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will," said Sabine Bob. There was a grim
smile on her lips; and she squared her shoulders as if
to give herself courage for some dreaded ordeal.
"There is a way."</p>

<p>But to the startled, eager question in the other's eyes,
she vouchsafed no answer. She came to her and put
her hands firmly on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Tina, will you promise not to believe anything you
hear them say about me? Will you promise to keep
on loving me just the same?"</p>

<p>The girl clung to her. "Oh, yes, yes," she promised.
"Always!" and then, in a shy whisper, she
added: "And some day&mdash;I will not be the only one
to love you."</p>

<p>Sabine Bob gave her a quick, almost violent kiss, and
went out, not stopping for even a word of good-night.
And the next day she put her plan into execution.
There was a perfectly relentless logic about Sabine
Bob. She saw a thing to do; and she went and did it.</p>

<p>As soon as her dinner dishes were washed and put
away, she donned her old brown coat and the little
yellow-black hat that had served her winter and summer
from time immemorial, and proceeded to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
dozen calls on her friends, up and down the street.
Wherever she went she talked, volubly, feverishly. She
railed; she threatened; she vociferated; and the object
of her vociferations was Thomas Ned. He had promised
to marry her; and he had deserted her; and she
would have the law on him! Marry her he must, now,
whether he would or no.</p>

<p>"See that word?" she demanded, displaying her
sheaf of compromising post-cards. "That word is
<i>wife</i>; and the man who calls me wife must stick to it.
I am not a woman to be made a fool of!"</p>

<p>So she stormed away, from house to house. Her
friends tried to pacify her; but the more they tried, the
more venom she put into her threats. And soon the
news spread through the whole town. Nothing else
was talked of.</p>

<p>"She's crazy," people said. "But she can make
trouble for him, if she wants to, no doubt about it."</p>

<p>Sabine laughed grimly to herself. She was going to
succeed. The scheme would work. She knew the kind
of man Thomas Ned was: full of shifts. He had
proved that already. He would never face a thing
squarely. He would look for a way out.</p>

<p>She was right. It was only ten days later, at high
mass, that the success of her strategy was tangibly
proved. At the usual point in the service for such announcements,
just before the sermon, Father Beauclerc,
standing in the pulpit, called the banns for
Thomas Boudrot, of Petit Espoir, North, and Tina
Mélanie Brigitte Lejeune, of the Ponds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>The announcement caused a sensation. An audible
murmur of amazement, not to say consternation, went
up from all quarters of the edifice, floor and galleries;
even the altar boys exchanged whispers with one another;
and there was a great stretching of necks in the
direction of Sabine Bob, who sat there in her uncushioned
pew, very straight and very red, with set lips,
while her rough old fingers played nervously with the
rosary in her lap.</p>

<p>This was her victory! She had never felt the ugliness
of her fifty years so cruelly before. A bony, ridiculous
old maid, making a fool of herself in public!
That was the sum of it! And all her life she had been
so careful, so jealously careful, not to do anything
that might cause her to be laughed at!</p>

<p>She could hear some of the whispers that were being
exchanged in neighboring pews. "Poor old thing!"
people were saying. "But how could she expect anybody
would want to marry her at her age!"</p>

<p>A trembling like ague seized her, and she felt suddenly
very cold and very very weak. She shut her eyes,
for things were beginning to flicker and whirl; and
when she opened them again, they were caught and
held by the picture above the high altar.</p>

<p>It was the Mother. The Mother and the Little
One. He lay in her arms and smiled.</p>

<p>The tears gushed up in Sabine Bob's eyes, and a
smile of wonderful tenderness and peace broke over
the harsh lines of her face and transfigured it, just for
one instant. It was a victory; it <i>was</i> a victory;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
though nobody knew it but herself; just herself, and
one other, and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Sabine still gazed at the picture, poor old Sabine
Bob in her brown coat and faded little yellow-black
hat: and the Eternal Mother returned the gaze of the
Eternal Mother, smiling; and it didn't matter very
much after that&mdash;how could it?&mdash;what people might
think or say in Petit Espoir.</p>

<p>Once more, that afternoon, as she slashed the suds
over the dishes, Sabine Bob was singing. You could
hear her way down there on the street, so buoyant and
so merry was her voice:</p>
